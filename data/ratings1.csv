Are you prepared for AWESOMENESS,10,"I really wasn't expecting much, other than a few laughs, which would have been OK for a Dreamworks animation movie. But KUNG FU PANDA exceeded all expectations. The story is simple but the execution is superb. It would be really difficult to find something to improve on the production. The voice-overs are really good, esp Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman. The animation is very rich and the colors are crisp and bright. The action sequences are breath-taking. The laughs are mixed in at the appropriate moments. The theater was full and it was composed of a mixture of Adults and young kids. This is a fun for all movie. A testament to this fact is that almost the whole crowd stayed for the end credits. This is a very rare occurrence nowadays.\Oh.. and I hope this does not count as a spoiler. I absolutely loved the Samurai-Jack type animation for some scenes.",7 June 2008
Wasn't Expecting much - Got a very good movie,8,I was almost dreading seeing this movie - we won tickets to the screener and from the first scene I found myself laughing out loud. The movie is so much better than I thought it would be (and that was bad) - I expected the comedy to be slapstick/junior/potty but it wasn't. The story was also good enough to keep my kids focused glued to the screen. The animation is wonderful. Music is tasteful. I can't imagine anyone but Jack Black pulling off the voice though - he definitely made the movie for me. The only thing distracted me was that most of the movie I spent trying to figure out who was doing the voice of Tai Lung (Ian McShane). As mentioned previously in the forums about the pop culture references in this movie - I don't remember one - very nice indeed - it works with some of the other movies but I can do without. This is the first movie in a while I'd like to see again.,4 June 2008
Entertainment in its purest form,9,"Like many others, I saw the ""trailers"" featuring Jack Black. The featurette made me think ""Okay, at least I got to check this out"". Not much more. It didn't make me think ""This is gonna be awesome"" or anything like that.Boy, was I ever under-expecting.At first I thought it was quite okay, decent entertainment and at least not totally crap. But then the really funny scenes and details kicked in, after Po gets into the temple. From then on, it was laugh after laugh, excellent voice acting, amazing CG animation (but this is Dreamworks so I expected that).The whole deal simply hit home run for me. Spot on. I love martial arts movies, I love Dreamworks CG movies and I must admit I find Jack Black amazingly funny (saw Be Kind Rewind the other day and loved it). There was so much charm and amusement in this movie. It's without doubt the best animation from Dreamworks since the first Shrek.Now, I am not saying this will be for everyone. There IS a lot of fighting going on, and while it is (for most of the movie) comical (yet amazing to behold) violence, it might not be suitable for the smallest of children. But for any healthy kid aged 6-7 or above (especially boys), this will be kick-a**! I cannot really put my finger on anything bad. Sure, the movie is filled with clichés, but sometimes you can go a long way with those. And this one serves them perfectly. I even rated this higher than Ratatouille, due to the fact that it took me totally by surprise. With Ratatouille, I EXPECTED it to be great. Kung Fu Panda I only expected to be decent, but it was awesome. That deserves the last point.",7 June 2008
"Finally, Dreamworks Animation has a classic.",10,"After various 3D animated movies ranging from lacklustre ""star"" movies (""Madagascar""), boring tripe (""Shark Tale"", ""Bee Movie""), and over-rated, over-hyped overkill (""Shrek""), Dreamworks can finally be proud of a truly great film. (Sidebar: I actually enjoyed ""Flushed Away"" and ""Over The Hedge"".) First, the bad. If I could complain about ANYTHING it may be a few of the voices. Besides Po, Shifu and Oogway, the rest of the cast seemed pretty 'phoned-in'. Thankfully, those characters are pretty inconsequential so they're not really missed.Now the good... or rather great. While classic kung fu movies are poked fun at, Kung Fu Panda does an excellent job of treating the genre with great respect in a movie geared towards kids. And while it IS kid friendly, it is not dumbed down to the point where it's childish. All the classic elements of those great kung fu flicks are there, while still keeping it pleasantly G-rated.Let me get this out of the way: this movie has some of the greatest 3D animated fight scenes. Ever. What elevates them from good to great is that while I expected the unbelievable, gravity-defying stunts that are REQUIRED of a good kung fu movie, there is an amazing amount of 'realism' to the physics in this movie. Just watch the jailbreak and you'll understand.Speaking of animation, the cinematography, character design and backgrounds are all done very, very well. Whether it's flying through the air alongside a leaping character, the painting-like backgrounds, or the wonderful opening sequence (reminiscent of Samurai Jack), they're all beautiful. Snap zooms, slow-motion, and flying cameras are also used with great skill to further the experience.Even the music and sound is outstanding. Asian drums rumble in the background of intense fights... stones shatter and crumble away... fight sequences rise and fall with each of the music cues, or is that the other way around? Beautiful.What helps make this a new classic in my eyes is what it doesn't have. There are no Matrix, Spiderman, or other dated references. There are no inside jokes related to the voice actors. There isn't even any double entendre or unnecessary crude humour. Much like ""Finding Nemo"" or ""Monsters Inc"", there's just plenty of pop-culture-free goodness that is terribly entertaining.The last great part of this movie is often the most overlooked part of a good family film... heart. This movie has oodles of it. Other movies have tried to have a lesson in the end like 'be yourself' (""Shrek""), or 'the value of friends' (""Madagascar""), or... 'be yourself' (""Shark Tale""), but ""Kung Fu Panda"" has genuine cinematic moments with dialogue that carries real weight. Best line: Oogway regarding yesterday, tomorrow and today.So, finally, as a complete sucker for Pixar animation, I'm glad that another animation company can actually put proper thought and execution into a FAMILY movie. What else can I say? Congratulations Dreamworks. 10 out of 10.",9 June 2008
"Kick ass movie, almost note perfect",9,"I saw this movie in the Cinema last night. I can not recommend this movie highly enough to kids of all ages. it is a long, long time since i have heard a Cinema audience laughing so much during a movie ( i think the last time was during Gigli!).Finally Dreamworks have managed to surpass the achievements of Pixar. All the elements are beyond anything i have seen in an Animated movie since The Lion King. the animation is hugely detailed and achingly beautiful, the script is the best i have come across in years. the only bum note in this symphony of fun is the fact that some of the immensely talented voice cast are badly underused. i can only remember hearing Jackie Chan's voice 3 times at most. having said that, the movie rests on the shoulders of jack Black and Dustin Hoffman. while playing their parts in a very different manner to each other, both are note perfect. they invest their characters with an energy (Black) and dignity (hoffman) that i could not find any fault with, even if i wanted to, not that i want to.Lastly, i believe that Oogway is the best animated character ever rendered, his facial expressions are hilarious and-surpass any previous attempts to give a character convincing facial expressions (i consider Gollum to be a CG character, not an animated character, for the record).in short, this is an utterly fantastic movie that everyone should watch 9/10",28 June 2008
"Exceptionaly visual, funny, action packed and intelligent movie for all ages.",10,"One of the best comedy movies I've seen, this animation feature is both packed with action and intelligent at the same time. It's yet another variation on ""You can do anything if you believe in yourself"" and carries strong morale and educational message. But the way it's done, the incredible visual side of the story, as well as the dialogs, is just exceptional. You can't but love the fat Panda boy who's dreaming about being the greatest warrior of all China only to wake up to the reality of hawing to serve noodle soup in his father's shop. Unlike his father, who also dreamed but never found the courage to act on it, Panda follows his calling and by ""luck"" get chosen to be the legendary Dragon warrior by the Kung-Fu grand master, the old turtle, to defeat the evil tiger. That's when his training and troubles start. It's really for anyone between 3 and 100 and I laughed and loved it from the titles in the beginning to the very end. Much recommended.",28 June 2008
Dreamworks hits a HOME RUN with this one!,10,"From the very beginning, Kung Fu Panda had me practically falling out of my seat --- laughing. It was the perfect blend of comedy, heart, and action, all necessary elements in a successful and great animation/CGI film, in the tradition of The Incredibles and (less action, but containing the heart and laughter) Ratatouille, Finding Nemo and Monsters, Inc.I took my wife and nephew and niece to see it on a Friday night and they enjoyed it, too! We were totally laughing, smiling, and guffawing at Po, the main protagonist (voiced by Jack Black) and his misadventures at becoming a Kung Fu expert. This was certainly a flawed character, one that a lot of people can relate to because he dreams, he's funny, and he can laugh at himself. Also, the story was pretty clear and easy to follow because the storytelling was well crafted, and the animation was paired well with characters brought vividly to life by some of the most famous names in Hollywood. Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman are downright excellent as the main characters, and Ian McShane as the bad dude gave it the right fearful presence. Other big name stars don't shine as much, but that's because their roles are rather limited in the film. But that's still okay because the animators should be given equal credit (if not more) for delivering the funny, action and heart elements of this movie in an effective, amazing and (I've got to use this) AWESOME manner. Visually, this movie is stunning (notice all those scenic shots of the Chinese mountains, bodies of water, and the bridge scene; not to mention the action animation version of ""The Matrix"" with slow-mo)... simply a delight to watch.It's clear that Dreamworks has gotten back in the animation game with Kung Fu Panda, after slight ho-hums in Shrek 3 and Bee Movie (call me crazy, but I liked Over The Hedge more than those two). Hopefully, it should earn well over $500M worldwide because it is so good.This movie rightfully belongs in the top animation movies of all time (okay, let's not include the classic fairy tales of old; let's begin with the 90's onwards), alongside my faves ""The Incredibles"" ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Beauty & The Beast."" Has the makings of being a classic.My wife and I enjoyed it so much that we saw it again the night after. And maybe another time... haha!Enjoy!",8 June 2008
Jack Black is the Greatest Panda in the World!,10,"Caught a screening of ""The Panda"" and all I can say is wow! I took my 6 year old daughter, who has the attention span of a 6 year old, and she wants to see it again. So do I! Jack Black is not only half of the greatest band in the world, he is also a fine voice actor. His flawed character, Po the Panda is very refreshing. So is this film. After having to sit through the boring ""Over the Hedge"" and the last two ""Shrek"" messes, I really appreciated an animated feature form Dreamworks that didn't have too many celeb voices all competing for screen time. This is Jack Black's movie. He has 75% of the lines in the script and that is not a bad thing. Don't just drop the kids off to see Kung Fu Panda. Go with them. I think it's one of those rare movies like The Incredibles and Finding Nemo that adults can enjoy as much as the kids.",4 June 2008
Cute animated comedy that inspires lessons in life,8,"(Synopsis) Kung Fu Panda is the story of Po, (voice Jack Black), a sweet, but clumsy Panda who has dreams of fighting with the legendary Furious Five and protecting the city against all threats. The only problem is that Po has no real life experience of kung fu, and his real job is serving noodles at his dad's noodles shop. News of selecting the Dragon Warrior is sent out from the Jade Temple, and the whole city along with Po, go to the celebration. The competition is between the Furious Five: Tigress (voice Angelina Jolie), Viper (voice Lucy Liu), Crane (voice David Cross), Monkey (voice Jackie Chan), and Mantis (voice Seth Rogen). Po accidentally enters the contest and is named the Dragon Warrior. Master Shifu (voice Dustin Hoffman) must find a way to train Po and make him a Kung Fu Master, especially, after they learn that the snow leopard, Tai Lung (voice Ian McShane), is headed their way.(My Comment) This is a cute animated comedy that also inspires lessons in life. The audience can relate to people who have dreams of doing the impossible, just as Po. Po ultimately learns that if he believes in himself, he can do anything. Jack Black (Po) and Dustin Hoffman (Shifu) voices were just right for their parts, and the chopstick fight between them is fantastic. Ian McShane (Tai Lung) was also wonderful as the villain, and his battle sequence on the rope bridge is spectacular. This film is for the whole family, because adults will enjoy the movie just as much as their children. (DreamWorks, Run Time 1:28, Rated PG)",6 June 2008
I just saw the screening of this movie in the Chicagoland area,10,"I Love it! The story was great and the background was beautiful, it really felt like an ancient Chinese city. This original story is one of the best since Shrek. And the meaning behind the story may be even better! The story is about Po, an overweight panda who is the son of a noodle maker, who dreams of Po following in his footsteps. But Po longs to be a ninja fighter. Po is as you know is a panda bear and the film's unlikely hero: as the bigger than life and completely lovable bear voiced by the comic genius Jack Black. Po is a Sweet but clumsy, bear who hears the news the ancient and long awaited dragon warrior will be named, so he runs (as much as he can) to hear who will be named at the celebration.Without giving too much away, when an ""accident"" seems to name Po as the dragon warrior (much to the horror of Master Shifu (voiced perfectly by Dustin Hoffman) and the disappointment of Furious Five: Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Viper (Lucy Liu), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Crane (David Cross) and Monkey (Jackie Chan). Shifu must find a way to train him. One hilarious moment after another continues until Shifu recognizes Po's true driving force. This is just in time as the villain Tai Lung (Ian McShane), a snow leopard has returned as he believe is the true Dragon Warrior.I can not recommend this movie enough. Certainly this is marketed for the kids  but the whole family will enjoy it.",17 May 2008
A True Warrior Never Quits,7,"In China, the big, fat and clumsy Panda Po is a great fan of martial arts and worships The Furious Five - Tigress, Crane, Mantis, Viper and Monkey – and their Master Shifu. He works in the restaurant of his father specialized in noodles, but he dreams on being a kung fu hero. When Master Oogway summons the population to announce who would be The Dragon Warrior, he surprisingly points out to the slacker Po, frustrating the expectations of Master Shifu and Tigress. Po joins the academy of Master Shifu that does not believe that Po might be The Dragon Warrior. Meanwhile the evil Tai Lung breaks out the high-security prison where he has been arrested for twenty years and heads to the temple of Oogway, expecting to get the Dragon Scroll and becomes more powerful. The Furious Five tries to intercept Tai Lung, but they are defeated. Now the only chance to stop Tai Lung is the glutton Po.""Kung Fu Panda"" is a very funny and entertaining animation, with the delightful story of a clumsy Panda that dreams on being a hero. The computer-animated heroes and villain are hilarious, supported by the voices of Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angeline Jolie and other magnificent actors and actresses. Po is tailored for Jack Black and I can not imagine this character without his voice. Dustin Hoffman also makes the difference with the voice of the wise Master Shifu. I just regret that I did not pay much attention to this animation before and only now I have watched it. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Kung Fu Panda""",18 March 2011
Recommendation from a Chinese,10,"First I need to make it clear that since I was born and grew up in China, this review might be biased because there is so much more I appreciate from the movie, given my cultural background.There is a specific category in the Chinese literature history called Kung Fu fictions and it had spread among generations currently between 12 - 60 years old. Have to admit, this movie touched deeply on that, far more than any Jackie Chan or Jet Lee movies. Because it is animated, it leaves more rooms for imaginations.I am very satisfied with the movie, though I watched it with my American-born kids. It is still a typical Hollywood production, but somehow, it touched my Chinese heart.It is a simple story, yet deep. See it if you haven't already.",18 June 2008
The Best Animated Feature in the Past 2 Years !!!,10,"I LOVED this movie!!!! I even daresay that this is the best animated motion picture I have seen since ""Cars"" two years ago. Although the whole story of an underdog turned champion is admittedly an oft-told retread, the treatment is original and amazing and very engaging, and not corny (unlike a lot of the recent animated films). I cannot stop singing praises to this one. The artwork of the whole movie is fantastically rendered, no exquisite detail was spared in the scenery, the architecture and of course, the lead animal characters.The action and fight scenes are very well done and memorable. I enjoyed watching the fight scene between Po and Shifu for the last dumpling, the fight of the Five vs. Tai Lung at the Bridge, and the climactic fight scene of Tai Lung with Shifu, and then with Po. Very exciting. My daughter even spontaneously applauded after that last fight sequence.There were also a number of beautifully-crafted emotional moments throughout. I loved the inspirational talk of Master Oogwei and Po (loved those words of wisdom), the talk of Master Oogwei and Shifu with the peach blossom petals, and of course the touching moment of Po and Shifu after the battle, and even in that small extra scene after the credits.The voice acting was also very good. Jack Black as Po, so natural the comedian, wow. Dustin Hoffman as Shifu, really great. I did not expect it to be him. If was fun to discover after the movie that is was Angelina Jolie who voiced the Tigress, Lucy Liu, the Viper, and Jackie Chan, the Monkey, among others. And even more minor characters like the menacing head of prison security rhino Commander Vachir voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan, all very good.Overall, a fantastic movie experience that I would not mind watching over and over. There is something for everyone -- action, drama, and comedy. It is an animated classic in my book. Very highly recommended indeed!",8 June 2008
Wow.... Dreamworks' finest.,10,"When I watched the trailers to kung fu panda, I scoffed and sneered at the stupidity of a rude panda barging in and demanding to learn kung fu. If someone had asked me to go to that movie, I would have laughed in their faces, but gone anyway for the popcorn. As I watched the preview, I thought ""Well there's a waste of time and money, There's something I would never like."" ...Boy was I wrong. Kung fu panda has splashes of children and adult humor, done by the perfect Jack black, who fit so well with Po, the roly poly, cuddly panda. The scenery was breathtaking, and most of the time I forgot that the majestic shimmering water and lovely smooth trees were fake! The Thins that most surprised me was all the heart put into it. On the previews they are targeting mostly youths and younger audiences with their humor, but really the thing that I found sweetest of all was all the heart. The moral was so touching and sweet, that I could have never expected Dreamworks to pull it off, after their recent garbage like ""Over the Hedge"" ""Shark Tale"" and others.The scenery was beautiful, and the animation was outstanding! The characters fit so well with their voices, especially my all time favorite character Master Shifu voiced by Dustin Hoffman. True, Jackie Chan and the furious five didn't have too many lines, but this does not stop the upbeat trhill and flow of the movie. I am Definitely buying this movie the second it comes out on DVD, and have seen it 7 times in the theater. The battle scenes are superb, and my entire family is getting sick of me talking about them. The storyline is very original, and bright, but within all the humor there is a heart, and other emotions,such as sadness. One of my favorite scenes is the one in which the Brave Master Shifu battles with his former pupil, the vicious (and I mean vicious) Tai Lung.All the characters add their own little sparkle to the story, like sweetness being added to a cake. I really can't express my utter love for kung fu panda-It would be like trying to type out love, or music- it just can't be done. Sincerely, Piggypony",30 June 2008
Not only Good but also Makes me think.,9,"Kungfu Panda is marketed mainly as a children's movie with very childish style of cartoon-making and Jack Black. But it turned out to be eccentric and wonderful, a good story to bring your family to. If the box office becomes a flop(which is already impossible), it should be attributed to the marketing only.As the tag line says, ""Prepare for awesomeness."" Even after so many positive comments, I still have no idea what the movie will come out like. One reason I couldn't figure out what the movie will be about is the super-simple title. Will it be just another Forbidden Kingdom? Or another Mulan? Or will it even turns out to be another Bulletproof Monk, which is among the disgraces to the Chinese culture? Sorry about this but I've seen too many movies portraying Chinese culture too superficial, which assumes Chinese philosophy established on either Buddhism(usually fake Buddhism) or some ridiculous superstition. So first of all, I am glad to say Kung fu Panda is the first Hollywood-made Chinese movie ever to make me feel proud for my ancestors' culture. If I haven't guessed it wrong, the writers really took some time digesting Chinese philosophies like the relationship between ""Beings"" and ""none-beings"", and other basic Chinese ideas about life and faith. No matter how old you are, the movie will make think for some time. It discussed some deep topics about human desire, confidence and destiny. After seeing it, I sincerely think that human desire can be used for good, for our bodies are like super-advanced machines and if you manage it in the right way, it won't be harder than controlling machines. Ancient Chinese assimilated so many nutrition from nature that they have a vision to achieve a balance between everything, that is also a reminding to me as a Chinese, which makes me proud.The visual style of the movie completely beat my expectations. Everything is animated in a Chinese paper art style and the color red is so widely used as the main theme color. It touched me deeply because it reminded me of the glorious days of Chinese cartoons. It's like a combination of Matrix and traditional kung fu movies.For many obvious reasons, it has the potential to win the Oscar. I am looking forward to some better cartoons this year. But at the same time I want Kongfu Panda to be the best animated feature of the year.9/10 Almost excellent.",16 June 2008
Kung Fu + Computer graphics = a winner!,8,"When you watch Kung Fu Panda you can't help but wonder: why wasn't this done before? Kung fu and CGI make a terrific mix in this entertaining tale of a clumsy fat panda who becomes a true kung fu master. The story in short: panda bear Po (voiced by Jack Black) is a big kung fu fan. He has all the action figures of his idols, Master Tigress, Viper, Tigress, Monkey and Mantis - also known as the Furious Five, and dreams of one day becoming a kung fu master himself. In the meantime he sells noodles. When evil leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane) escapes from prison a Dragonwarrior is chosen to defeat him. Yes, our reluctant hero Po turns out to be the one! He gets a kung fu training from Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), who - after a few disastrous attempts - discovers that the only way to teach Po real kung fu is to lure him with food. But will Po be strong enough to beat Tai Lung?Kung Fu Panda doesn't start with a bang. The first laughs are results from the slapstick humour. Po is a lovable creature and everyone can relate to a person who dreams of the impossible. When Tai Lung escapes you're really into the story. This particular scene is pretty spectacular. It takes place in a dark cave and the way Tai Lung jumps around really gives you the impression that he's an enemy to be reckoned with.What also works in the movie is the chemistry between Po (Jack Black) and Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman). The latter easily steals the show as the grumpy kung fu master who doesn't believe in his mission to guide Po. The scene in which Shifu has a food fight with Po is an instant classic. There's also a great action scene in which Tigress, Mantis and the others try to stop evil Tai Lung. They fail, of course... And the down side? There aren't that many bad things in Kung Fu Panda. Hoffman and Black make the movie. The role of Tigress (Angelina Jolie) could have been done by many other voice actresses. Jackie Chan (Viper) only has three or four lines and that's a shame. The final fight is - at some moments - rather violent. That can scare away some of the younger (3-6 year old) kids. Dreamworks wants to turn Kung Fu Panda into a Shrek like franchise. They're right. There's enough material in here to make at least two more sequels. And CGI animated kung fu kicks really work on the big screen! So let them make a Kung Fu Panda 2. As long as they keep Dustin Hoffman as Master Shifu in the story!8/10",22 May 2008
One of the five best CGI animated films ever!,8,"After the disappointing SHREK 3 and the only ""cute"" OVER THE HEDGE, DreamWorks Animation finally delivers another highlight to the CGI animated universe.I got used to the rather simple story of MADAGASCAR after watching it again, I really liked SHREK and even more SHREK 2 (am I the only one?). I never liked the cultural references they built in, because I think they only work in their time (but in their time they worked great!). So for me KUNG FU PANDA is the first great ""classic"" DWA film. Go see it, it also works for adults. If you have seen some of the classic martial arts film (Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee etc) you will even more enjoy it. The voice talent of Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman and Ian McShane is perfectly used. The other voices are OK.It will be a big hit for DWA, north of 200 millions domestic, eventually even 300 mil.That said, my favorite CGI's are 1. THE INCREDIBLES, 2. RATATOUILLE and 3. FINDING NEMO and closely followed by KUNG FU PANDA. Looking forward to seeing KFP an second time and then maybe it will become my new Nr. 3.",27 May 2008
Awesome....Awesome!!!!!,10,"What a fabulous movie...great output from Dreamworks...This is the film, can be watched by all section of audience...very entertaining...The artists selection was too good....Jack Black the real show stealer...I don't think there was any expectations about this movie before release, but if you go with high expectations, definitely it reaches beyond.The story as follows, Po(Jack Black),a panda who helps his father make and serve noodle soup. One day,an ancient tortoise named Oogway believes that Po is the Dragon Warrior. Po can't believe it, and neither does Master Shifu(Dustin Hoffman). When Master Shifu learns that a certain evil villain named Tai Lung escapes from prison, trains Po to defeat Tai Lung.Don't miss this movie at any cost. Kudos to the makers. 2nd part is on the way, hope that will be a stunner than this part.",3 June 2011
Best after the Nemo.,9,"Saw this movie today. It was both entertaining and imbibing good values. For kids a definite watch. For adults too.The story is a well known moral story of don't judge by the appearance. It is about a Chinese town in the valley where a kung-fu rule is about to be seized by a evil spirited tiger who wants to become The Dragon Warrior, the great. And a Panda comes in his way to achieve it.The script is very good. Dream works artwork team has proved one more time. It was very funny from the beginning to the end. And some philosophical moments too. The music and colors used in the movie reminds Chinese in every aspect and mainly kung-fu. It no way is lesser than ordinary kung-fu film. Kung-fu fight scenes drawn with such a clarity. Colors used are mostly red and yellow. Some flash back and magical related scenes have been drawn to bluish grey. The effects came out were extremely good. My credit goes to directors who could imagine the whole thing in their minds to make this film.Animation films have been reaching new dimensions. Though this one did not create any new dimension but will be still one among the classics. Liked a few 'Zen'nish philosophical lines of the Master Turtle character such as 'there are no accidents'.. ""i am the big Panda'..'past is history... future is mystery... and present is the only gift you have that is why they call it as 'present'...they have most profound meanings which the film could casually spill it on its way.Ver good movie. A must watch.",28 June 2008
Finally a Film About China the Chinese Love,10,"There have been many films about China that the Chinese themselves didn't like. They didn't like Disney's ""Mulan"", they didn't like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". This list goes on. Westerners have westernized the stories or included elements culturally offensive or unintelligible, and humour that, in the Orient, just isn't funny. Well, all that has changed. Last night I went to see Kung Fu Panda in Shanghai (in English with Chinese subtitles). Shangahai is the biggest city in China. The cinema was packed. And from start to finish there was non-stop laughter, excitement, and joy. The humour was universally funny, the culture was dead-on, and the story hit home with the Chinese. They could relate to the characters and their situations. They laughed. They laughed until they cried. Visually, the movie was just beautiful to look at. As an adult, I usually don't enjoy watching cartoons. But this one was more fun I've had at the movies in a long time. The timing of the film's release with the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing coming up is perfect. A job well done to all involved with the making of this little gem!",25 June 2008
Awesome movie! I've seen this in cinema for twice!,10,"I can't exactly describe my feelings when I first saw this movie yesterday. It's awesome. The dreamworks has done really a good job in expressing Chinese cultural elements! It made me and my friends and all the audience laughed from the beginning to the end. When the movie came to its end, 90% of the audience didn't leave the room as usual. They stayed until the HP picture came out! Every scene is so precious and lovely that everyone didn't want to miss it! As a Chinese citizen, my feelings are complicated when I saw that the culture are so nicely expressed on screen by some foreign movie makers, but it's good, isn't it? Chinese movie makers should learn a lot from Hollywood.I think Kung Fu Panda perfectly gets together several important Chinese cultural elements: traditional Chinese Kung Fu Tactics, traditional Chinese fighting story, traditional Chinese jokes, traditional Chinese scenes, traditional Chinese music, even traditional Chinese legends! I also like the song after the movie.Thank you, Dreamworks!! I'm seriously considering to go to see it for the third time!",21 June 2008
A Nutshell Review: Kung Fu Panda,10,"It seems like this is a movie made for all the fanboys out there,  regardless of what their obsessions are about. You know, being one who  idolizes certain somebodies or some things, and given a day that Fate  decides to throw you a curveball and give you that one opportunity to  come up close and personal to meet and greet your idol in the flesh, or  be thrown into the exact situation that you've always been dreaming  about. What would you do, and would you go weak in the knees or be  overcome with disbelief that you're actually, finally, realizing your  dream?  Panda Po (voiced by comedian Jack Black) epitomizes exactly that in  Kung Fu Panda, and that struck a chord in me and with many in the  audience as well. And for that, no matter how cliché the story would  become, it had already done its deal and made the connection. It is no  wonder it is rated G here, and I expect that the holiday season would  allow cash registers to ring, for animation fans with the different  styles utilized to tell the story (you must be on time and not miss the  opening sequence), for kung fu fans to get a kick out of classic kung  fu moves personified in their animal forms - Tigress (Angelina Jolie),  Crane (David Cross), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Monkey  (Jackie Chan) - collectively known as the Fearsome/Fab Five, and for  the kids, given the obvious reason that hey, the protagonist is a  cuddly bear. The marketing department, if not already done, should  stock up on the plush toys, not only of the hero, but the supporting  casts as well. And make their younger forms available too, for they  will sell.  Story-wise, I can't help but to note its tip of its hat towards the  Jackie Chan martial arts movie of the past like Snake in Eagle's  Shadow, Eagle Shadow Fist, etc. The formula which follows a misfit with  weak or zero martial arts background having to undergo harsh training  under a kung fu master, finally realizing his true calling in time to  defeat the villain everybody fears. With the Jackie Chan movies, the  demise of loved one always trigger off a chain reaction, but since this  is G-rated, you won't have the pleasure of having blood spilled, but  with so many splatter-type movies in recent times, I have to admit this  was refreshing, and even having animated animals that talked, didn't  irk me as they are just so lovable here, in their own right.  It's an excellent and very even mix of comedy and drama, even though  they are quite cliché at times if you grew up with the formula, but I  thought that was the point. While the trailers might have given away  some stuff, there are still lots more available which are hidden up the  sleeves, and some minor word replacement such as ""suck"" to ""stink"",  though you would likely be able to stay a step ahead throughout and  even guess whatever secrets the movie have, actually are. For its  stylistic training sequences, they became a throwback and a link to the  fore-mentioned Jackie Chan movies. The fight choreography isn't done  shoddily too with its designing of fights true to the characters'  forms, and integrating them all in a manner rarely seen before. Since  it's an animated flick, it was able to, and probably ramped up  whatever's possible in the kung fu fantasy realm, to give us everything  from rooftop flights to an incredible prison break. It didn't waste any  effort in tapping from the wealth of kung fu material, what with the  various names of deadly moves, secret manuals,  teacher-student feuds, and the best part of it all? Humour being quite  unexpectedly well placed, with more hits than misses to break out into  a hearty laugh by the panda antics.  For all its A-list voice actors in the movie, with the likes of Michael  Clarke Duncan, Dan Fogler, Ian McShane and those who provide voices to  the 5 key animals, Kung Fu Panda is clearly a Jack Black and Dustin  Hoffman vehicle. The bantering between the two is priceless as the  latter plays Sifu (duh) the master teacher, a highly-strung and serious  character who has a past they are shameful about (don't they all). And  as his own teacher Oogway (read: Wu Gui, aka tortoise, voiced by  Randall Duk Kim) advises, herein lies an opportunity for Sifu to  rediscover himself when training possibly the next-big-thing (pardon  the pun) Po, whom he foretold as the mythical Dragon Warrior. So begins  the forging of friendship, long lasting bonds and trust between the  two, even though they got off the wrong footing. And you can probably  feel for Po, because for a fanboy type, having your idols scoff at you  at first opportunity, is actually quite painful.  As a kids movie, there's almost always a message to take away. Here,  it's a reminder to believe in oneself, which I guess is a universal  theme to instill some confidence in the young ones. You might not look  the best, nor are the best amongst your peers, but so long as you have  that attitude to want to learn, that should put you in good steed. As a  summer blockbuster movie, it's fun, thoroughly entertaining, and  doesn't try to be too smart. It's likely to be a crowd pleaser across  all age demographics, and an ultimate popcorn fare, so long as you  manage to keep the popcorn away from the thieving hands of the panda.  And with this release beating local film Kung Fu Gecko to the screens,  I wonder what's the status currently on the Nickson Fong project.",6 June 2008
Fun animation from DreamWorks,8,"I hadn't got around to watching this film but as I'd heard good things about it I thought I'd check it out when it was on television. Initially I wasn't sure I'd enjoy it as I'm not really into 'talking animal' films; soon I was ignoring that and enjoying the humour and the story. The story itself is hardly new but tat didn't stop it being entertaining. Po is a panda who dreams of becoming a kung fu warrior fighting alongside the greatest warriors in China; unfortunately for him however he seems destined to become a noodle chef! One day the local kung fu master Oogway prophesied that a dangerous former student is going to escape from prison and return to seek his vengeance and steal the scroll that will make him the legendary Dragon Warrior. Oogway decides that he must find a new Dragon Warrior first; to this end he gathers everybody together to appoint the new warrior. Po is desperate to see the ceremony and in his efforts to see finds himself at the centre of the ceremony and being selected himself. Not surprisingly the five greatest warriors and their trainer are not impressed that a fat panda has been selected over them. When their enemy does indeed escape they head off to meet him while master Shifu attempts to train him. As is the way with such films Po finds that he has hidden depths and learns kung fu, the only question is will he learn the secret of the scroll and defeat the dangerous Tai Lung.While the two films are very different I couldn't help thinking about Star Wars due to the relationships between the main characters; Shifu was like Obi Wan as his best student turns bad, Oogway was similar to Yoda. I'm not sure if this was a deliberate reference, it didn't matter if it was though as they never really laboured the point; in fact the film was refreshingly free from obvious pop culture references which I suspect will lead to it having a greater longevity than some other Dream Works animations. The animation looked pretty good in a way that made the characters believable even though they are talking, kung-fu fighting animals! The voice actors did a decent job; they avoided giving their characters 'cartoony' voices that can be a problem with animation at times. Over all I'd recommend this as it is a good family film with nothing too offensive for children or too childish for adults; it might not be as good as Pixar's best but then what is?",18 June 2011
Awesomeness of the cute Panda,10,"My opinion:-- KungFuPanda is the best animated movie so far. I have seen almost all of them (toystory,incredibles,ratatullie,shrek,iceAge you name it). But KungFuPanda beats all of them. I enjoyed it thoroughly. It made us laugh like anything. Very good comedy scenes, well crafted anime art, Good action sequences, good Chinese landscapes, and very well told story. The screenplay is great. Special mention to the voices. Jack Black Rocks !! He blends into PO as if he was born to voice for PO. Dustin Hoffman suits perfect for Master Shifu. Dreamworks has surprisingly given an awesome anime picture. My 10 out of 10. I'm gonna watch this movie again. Highly Recommended.",27 June 2008
I went to theaters to see it twice!,10,"I enjoyed this movie a lot. Funny from beginning to end. Great special effects and animation. Engaging story and great voice acting. Jack Black really pulled it off and the complementing voices of Angelina Jolie and Jackie Chan really made this film shine.Jack Black brings his characteristic humor to this movie with great lines such as ""There is no charge for awesomeness, and attractiveness."" and a general style that makes him...Jack Black!The story was not only engaging but had real life lessons that are good for anyone to learn. It gave what seems like a child movie some depth. It might not change your life, but it sure is worth the $9.50 price of admission where I go to watch it.",18 June 2008
Panda Made for a Happy Day,10,"My boyfriend and I had to choose between this movie and the Zohan. Needless to say we were both glad we chose Kung Fu Panda. I would rather have sat through this movie with a bunch of rambunctious kids than an action thriller with a bunch of obnoxious teens. The animation was up several levels by entertaining the adults with fast paced action segments speckled with the genius humor of Jack Black. There was so much of this movie that no one but Jack Black could pull off. The special and sound effects were better, in my opinion, than Ratatouille. The dishes clanking, the light shining off metal objects..fabulous. Town characters were enjoyable, cute and entertaining for the little ones...and it was a refreshing time to see so many adults relax and laugh as heartily as the little ones. The scenery was at times so realistic and breathtaking. Yes...the ""skadoosh"" segment was hilarious. As were many other points in the movie. The voice cast was wonderful. Clark Duncan was intimidating, funny, and I think the little ones were endeared to him even though he was a big burly character. Hoffman..wow...several times I had to remind myself it was his voice. I really hope there is a sequel...I bet millions of kids will hope so too.",8 June 2008
Turtles and Wisdom,,"Dreamworks has finally made a cartoon I can stand. It has finally outgrown the limits of its founders, three men an the attitude of good enough. They've for the first time put more money into one of these than in the promotion of it. They've finally weaned themselves from the contracts with Microsoft.Three things impressed me. One was the attention to the characters, at least the top three. This really was world class. You can see it both in the writing and in the subtle way their faces are rendered. No expression is direct or static. Every expression fleets through a number of emotions. Its what good actors do, but animators aren't limited by the human instrument, so can make the expression of expressions more theatrical and therefore more effective. They did well here, wisely focusing on mouths and not eyes. (They still do poorly with teeth.)The third thing was the use of vertical space. They are catching up, and its only notable because it isn't Pixar/Disney. But it means that now even the dullest of animation shops has adopted the rule that when you can, use that third dimension in a way that physical cameras cannot. What they do here is not remarkable compared to what others are doing. But it is remarkable when the fat kid in the class gets interested in aerobics, the laggard thinks being smart is finally coolThis has one well engineered fold. It starts with a highly abstract cartoon. We know it is a cartoon, because it advertises itself this way. Then we are told it was only a dream, essentially the movie within the movie. This is at the same time the real cartoon starts, but we register it as reality. Its a good trick.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",15 June 2008
The best animated film from Dreamworks,8,"""Kung Fu Panda"" is easily the best film ever made by the Dreamworks animation studio. It was even better than ""Shrek"" and ""Over the Hedge"" (Both very good films) The animation was quite well made: Not only the characters look more ""Alive"" than in many other CGI productions, but also the atmosphere looks stylish and more than adequate for the tone of the film. The characters were very likable and the action scenes were not only very funny to watch, but also were much better directed than other boring live action films like ""300"" or ""Pathfinder"". Jack Black was great in his role as the main character, and the cast did a great job as well. I highly recommend this film to anyone! It has fun, action and adorable and likable characters. This is one of the best films of the 2008, along with ""Wall-E"". 10/10",17 June 2010
"Nothing Uproarious But Warm, Colorful & Likable",8,"This was a nice movie with likable characters but, frankly, I didn't find it anything memorable. Yes, it was beautiful artwork but I read where it was the most beautiful animation ever put on screen, and I didn't find it lived up to that. I guess my expectations were sky high, which made it almost impossible to meet. The story could have used more laughs, too. I think that was the main thing that slightly disappointed me: the humor was mild, not laugh-out-loud funny.Having said all that, it was enjoyable and it will put numerous smiles on your face as you watch it. I guess ""pleasant,"" ""agreeable,"" ""warm,"" etc., would be better words to describe the film. It is pretty, too, especially on Blu-Ray. I imagine this looked awesome on IMAX in the theater.Jack Black does a nice job of voicing the main character, ""Po,"" the panda that surprised everyone, including himself, on what he could achieve if he set his mind to it. That's another plus for the film: nice messages.Kids should like this more than adults but grownups will enjoy it, too.",23 November 2008
Awesome Colourful Kung Fu Creatures,,"'Kung Fu Panda' is another delightfully entertaining flick to come out this summer. Osbourne and Stevenson do a fine job in directing. What I really liked about the film is the sincere effort behind it and its lack of pretension and use of clichés. The directors stay focused on the main story which is Po's struggle. I could really relate to Po's dream and love for Kung Fu and his disappointment and lack of faith in failing to be successful in doing what he loves. The stellar voice cast that includes names like Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Ian McShane, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, David Cross and Randall Duk Kim is impressive but it is Jack Black's show all the way, followed by Dustin Hoffman. Black's comic timing is wonderful as he provides some of the very memorable laugh-out-loud moments and he brilliantly succeeds in making Po both endearing and funny. I would never have guessed that Hoffman was behind the voicing of Shifu. The actor does an excellent job. I wish Jackie Chan had more lines. The music and CGI are good enough. There's a lot of energy. It's colourful and very appealing to the eyes and it's funny as hell. What's not to love? In my opinion, 'Kung Fu Panda' is a winner with both adults and kids.",12 September 2008
What a perfect gem of a movie...,10,"This is just the sweet spot you want - animation perfection coupled with a fine story that delivers an extremely enjoyable, very funny lovely gum drop of a film.I think Dreamworks has easily surpassed Shrek (the first) with Kung Fu Panda. ""Shrek"" was great, but had so many puns because of the content (Fairy Tales) that it was almost too easy.With the law-of-diminishing returns Shreks and the passably funny Madagascar under their belt, I had low expectations for ""Kung Fu Panda."" Pleasant surprise is an understatement: the animators, screenwriters, storytellers, voice actors, and producers all brought their ""A game"" to this one. This should be considered at the very least a CGI animation and at worst a top 30 animation classic up there with the best from Disney and Pixar. I'd rate it very close to my Pixar favorites, ""The Incredibles,"" and ""Monsters, Inc."" I won't bother regurgitating the highlights of the plot - others have taken care of that. It's the quality of this movie that's stuck with me; e.g., more laugh-out-loud hilarious moments than I can possibly remember, the tightly woven plot, and the simple, yet powerful message that isn't weighted down with too much sentimentality. I was also drawn unexpectedly to the animation itself - it has such a strong, unique use of color I found that the palette was another element that lifted the film out of the ordinary dreck of CGI. This is just a great, fun, and very funny movie that is completely worth bringing the whole family to. Don't miss it.",23 June 2008
em..I think this movie is good for some children,10,"KungFu Panda is a cartoon and adventure movie! This movie is popular all over the world.Not only children like it, there are many teenagers that like it too. This movie is also very popular in Korea.The Korean singer Rain is the vocalist for the soundtrack. So many Rain's fans are going to watch this movie. I think it is a good idea to make this movie popular all over the world.I also like this movie very much. I hope this movie becomes a very famous movie!I had already seen this movie,too. The movie is so much better than I thought it would be. It is very interesting and exiting! I think it is a better than any other cartoon movies.",21 June 2008
Fun Flick!,8,"If awesome fight sequences, crazy- mazing animation, and Funny humor are your thing GO SEE THIS MOVIE!Who saw this coming? No one, everyone went into this movie thinking that it would be a stupid kid's movie (and personally I thought some of it was a bit too mature for the little kiddies in OUR audience) From one of the most incredible animated fight sequences, to a chaotic jail escape, to a dramatic bridge fight, to a hilarious final showdown.Even though the movie does get serious at some points, it never takes itself seriously... did that make any sense? Jack Black is PERFECT in the role of Po the Panda, as are all of the other actors in their respective roles.What's the only bad thing about this movie? THE TITLE! Who's gonna go up to their friends and be like ""Oh yea Kung Fu Panda was AWESOME!"" (oh yea, that's right, ME!) I originally said that Wall- E looks like the best animated movie of the year but I can now say that it has competition (Wall-E will still be the best, but it officially has competition)",12 June 2008
Kung Fu Panda-- A Worthy Addition to the Kung Fu Movie Genre,8,"Watching this movie should easily explain why the Kung Fu Movie Genre simply refuses to die ever since movie technology was brought into China in late 1910s-- Kung Fu is essentially about self-cultivation, and so usually involves a human-interest story no matter how simple or complicated the plot is. And as others have noted, despite the lack of any real originality (Kung Fu Animals have been long existed in Chinese fantasy literature/ animation, see 1965's ""Uproar in Heaven"")-- Kung Fu Panda is done with such style and skill (or the Chinese would say, ""Kung Fu"") that it easily explains, again, why the Kung Fu Movie Genre simply refuses to die.In a word, the whole ""Kung Fu Animals-imitating-humans-imitating-Animal styles Kung Fu"" gimmick WORKED (not to mention the comical sight of a Panda imitating other animals)-- because I was enjoying the detail and complexity of the Kung Fu Animation in much the same way I would enjoy the athleticism and aesthetics of real-life Kung Fu Action. And unlike some western attempts at Kung Fu Movies (most recently, The Forbidden Kingdom), Kung Fu Panda suffered less of the awkwardness in mixing foreign languages/ characters with Chinese languages/ characters-- because it is populated solely by animals (Peace Valley is basically a poultry & pig farm/ community) and consistently set in fantasy/ mythical China (duh, there are Kung Fu Animals...).So I will give Kung Fu Panda the honor of rating it as a Kung Fu Movie-- being rated ""G"" (in most Asian countries, ""PG"" in most western countries) is no excuse. MAJOR MAJOR SPOILERS follow:1) Most Missed-Opportunity Fight Scenes: Oogway vs. Tai Lung, Tai Lung vs. Peace Valley, and all the other ""flashback"" fight scenes-- we never really get to see how amazing or dangerous Oogway or Tai Lung can be.2) Most Spectacular Fight Scene: Tai Lung vs. the Rhinoes-- things were blowing up and crashing down in a way which would have made Tsui Hark & Stephen Chow proud.3) Most Well-Choreographed Fight Scene: Po vs. Sifu-- truly a compendium of some of the best chopsticks moves in the Kung Fu Movie Genre.4) Most Awesome Fight Scene: the Furious Five vs. Tai Lung-- it was just awesome to see the Furious Five teaming up in their only fight scene (the sparring scenes don't count), which would have been perfect if they had a chance to do Formation Fighting.5) Most Fearsome Fight Scene: Tai Lung vs. Sifu-- the only ""serious"" fight in the movie, because both fighters were able AND willing to kill each other. Sifu would have died if this movie was made for an western adult audience (or made for/ by the Chinese).6) Most Predictable Fight Scene: Tai Lung vs Po-- Po defeating Tai Lung with the use of natural and environmental advantages (ala Jackie Chan) actually took the ""edge"" off this climatic fight in favor of comic relief and made it look too easy for Po (Tai Lung has beaten everyone else), so much so that the final blow looks questionable. It might have worked with a (Hong Kong, not US) Jackie Chan or Stephen Chow for the right balance of comedy & drama, but Jack Black's style of (over-)cockiness diminished any real sense of danger for me.7) Most Unexpectedly Beautiful Scenes: the 2-D Opening Sequence-- because the ""distorted"" perspectives of ink-painting and shadow puppetry aesthetics actually work better in 2-D; and the almost monochromatic ""passing"" of Oogway-- because it was SO simple.8) Most Unexpectedly Funny Scenes: ""I wish my mouth was bigger"" Noodle-scene, ""Maybe you should have another look"" Acupuncture-scene, and almost every one of the precious few moments given to Mantis (or any of the Kung Fu Masters at the temple)-- it was just unusually comical having them actually act/ talk ""normally"" (real Kung Fu Masters are usually quite sedate/ focused), instead of over-acting like Hollywood comedians.My only gripe is that beside Po, none of the named characters such as the tortoise Oogway (Chinese for ""tortoise""), the master/ teacher Sifu (Chinese for ""master/teacher""), the tigress Tigress (erm, you get the idea), etc. were given enough screen time-- despite having more interesting personalities and back-stories than Po, the typical Kung Fu Movie protagonist (see Jackie Chan's late 1970's break-out Kung Fu Movies). A prequel about how the fastidiously over-achieving Sifu managed to warp Tai Lung into an unscrupulous over-achiever would be much appreciated... and yes, I smell a toy/ TV/ movie franchise.Oh, and a final word about the beautiful Chinese landscapes and architecture-- well, I'm a bit hard to please cos I've seen & climbed the real thing (looks to me like Tai-shan or Mt. Tai, with its 10 km stairway, mixed with various other parts of China)... but yeah, the animators did a GREAT job. ;)",10 June 2008
Kung Fu-n,8,"Jack Black is on form with his latest outing 'Kung-Fu Panda' a funny and excellently animated tale of dreams, ambition, self belief and of course Kung-Fu. Po is a panda stuck in his job at his dads noodle shop but as he cooks and serves he secretly dreams of being a Kung-Fu master and part of crack fighting force 'The furious five'. Trained by Shifu the five are being groomed so one will become the Dragon master and protect the village from the wrath of the evil Tai Lung and in a hilarious set up that task falls to the reluctant Po. Cue comedy training scenes and 'Karate Kid' style balances on one leg as the clumsy and unfit Po tries to become the ultimate fighting force. With an all star cast of voice talent here, Black, Hoffman, Jolie and Chan to name but a few, the characters are instantly likable, but what sets this film apart is really the animation which is simply stunning and often uses matrix style slow motion to great effect as the camera whirls you round a fight scene that just stays the right side of not making you dizzy. The story despite being heavy on the morale of believing in yourself and you can do anything rhetoric is a strong one and the script is full of great jokes. Add to this some fun slapstick and it should have the adults laughing along with the kids. To quote Po 'there is no charge for awesomeness' well the price of a cinema ticket anyway, but I assure you its well worth it.",30 June 2008
And then there's two Pandas!! 'Po' and 'Shifu'.,10,"When a layperson is introduced to the opus of Chinese Martial Arts, the animals,birds and insects commonly present in fighting techniques are Tiger,Snake,Monkey,Leopard,Crane,Mantis,Eagle,Horse,Tortoise,10000 bees,Centipede,Scorpion,Gecko,Toad and several other relatively unknown styles.There's also the mythical Dragon style.But Panda ? No buddy, there's no Panda.And that's specifically the reason I loved this movie.The giant, lazy, slow animal ( Giant Panda ) with it's affinity for food ,having probably the least chance to make it up to Kung-Fu ranks, becomes a hero in this incredible movie.And his master 'Shifu' is a small Red Panda !!But don't get me wrong.Not by magic.The Giant Panda is a large animal with considerable strength and it can be fast when needed.Po the Giant Panda was unexpectedly chosen by Tortoise guru Oogway to defend their valley from the wrath of the snow leopard 'Tai Lung' who was raised by Kung-Fu master Shifu, who is a Red Panda himself.Shifu has five of the best as his students: Tiger, Viper, Crane,Monkey and Mantis.But not one of them, or even, all of them together can defeat the Snow Leopard who used to be the best and most powerful of all of Shifu's students.Sadly 'Tai Lung''s lust for power turned him into a merciless outlaw.Only with the help of Tortoise Guru ( Shifu's master )'Oogway' could Tai Lung be sent into Prison.However Tai Lung breaks prison in an outstanding animation sequence that can compare with Hollywood's best action scenes, and is slated to come back to the valley and wreak havoc in his quest for a 'Secret' power.And now according to Oogway, only the gentle Panda 'Po'( with enough theoretical, bookish knowledge but no Real Kung-Fu experience ) can stop him,and Shifu has to train him in unconventional ways.Watch this movie with your entire family and you will love every second of it.The climax could have been more gripping.Even then, for innovation, a 10 out of 10.",21 June 2008
Amazingly good,8,"After seeing the commercials on TV for this one, I didn't want to see it. It looked inane and more of a children's movie than one for adults. Today, though, my friend wanted to go, and I was pleasantly surprised to see one of the best movies I've seen this year. I was first struck by the art work... not the CG/animation but the artwork, the backgrounds and sets of the scenes. They're stunningly beautiful, as is the soundtrack. Then the story pulled me in, even the minor things like why a Panda has a goose for a father. I really liked the ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""-type action scenes; they were really well done, using the characteristics of each character to add to what the character was able to do. The villain was especially well done, intimidating but not over-the-top scary that would scare small children. (There were many children in the theatre of course, but the movie kept them interested apparently because they were all well-behaved, engrossed in the movie.) The acting was well done as well. I'd wondered if Jack Black would be as funny when you can't see his physical humor, but I shouldn't have worried. I read a review of the movie this week that said Angelina Jolie wasn't very good. I'm not really a fan of hers, but I don't know what movie that reviewer saw; I thought she was great. In fact, I wish there had been more scenes and actions with the 5 Kung Fu warriors, the Monkey, the Snake, the Mantis, the Tiger and the Stork. They were all excellent as was the Kung Fu Master, voiced by Dustin Hoffman. Hopefully, there will be a sequel (done as well as this one was) and we will see more of those characters, and find out about Po's father.",8 June 2008
Awesomely Skadooshilicious,9,"Kung Fu Panda is both a send-up of and a tribute to the kung-fu genre, and it works. Innocent eyes will goggle at the beautifully rendered characters, break-neck action, and gentle humor; more experienced viewers will laugh at loud at all of the kung fu movie clichés... a hopeless loser that goes from zero to hero in about one day of intense training... a promising but evil student who turns against his master... the wise, ancient master... the prophesy... the various forms of animal-style kung-fu practiced by actual creatures of the correct type... it's all there, without any wires, and without the awful dialogue you would expect from a chop-sockey film. Jack Black entertains, and shares some excellent dialogue with Master Sifu, voiced by Dustin Hoffman. The Furious Five, a group of powerful Kung Fu warriors, is voiced by various big-name actors, but somehow, they rarely seemed to get enough voice-time to justify those big salaries - particularly Jackie Chan (Monkey), who had about three lines of dialogue. Presumably they based Monkey's movements on some of Jackie's more inspired moves from the past. This is where the film lost a point. An honorable mention should be given to James Hong, who voices Po's (Jack Black, the Panda) father's voice - apparently, PO is the son of a goose who owns a noodle shop. Ian McShane also deserves mention as Tai Lung, the immensely powerful evil Snow Leopard kung-fu master who must escape from prison and return to the valley in order to fulfill PO's destiny. See this movie. It brought awesomeness back to a genre that has seen a lot of crap in the past 5 years (anything with Star Wars in the title, anything starring Jackie Chan, anything directed by the Wachowski Brothers...), and it's even clean enough to bring your kids to. And to any naysayers, I say to you... SKA-DOOSH.",9 June 2008
Good,7,"I am not a big fan of Dreamworks' non-Aardman movies after Shrek. They used too many jokes, pop-culture references etc. instead of serving real story with real characters. The only exception is, I think, Over the Hedge, which, while not really Pixar-standard, is one where they didn't overuse pop-culture references but gave us lovable characters and a good story. I think Kung Fu Panda is closer to Over the Hedge than other Dreamworks-movies. Actually I didn't find real pop-culture references (while there may be a lot of references to martial arts movies - I lack knowledge of them - there is nothing that does not fit to the story and the characters) at all. Slapstick is very childish in the movie; I can understand that, they wanted to sell it to the little ones too. But other than that, and most of the time, it is a beautifully-animated kung-fu movie with great scenery that is more for adults and kung-fu movie lovers than for children. They even give time for character building, although it is only for the Panda and the two masters; others are really one-dimensional (they even don't really have too much screen time for more). The story is nothing new, but maybe that's not something you would expect from a Kung-fu movie. All in all, the movie is much more fun and sensitive but with less jokes than its ads suggest. i did like it even if I didn't love it - maybe you should be a kung-fu fan for the latter.",22 May 2008
A lot better than it looks!,10,"When I first heard the title, I was expecting this to be a movie with stupid, unoriginal humor. Boy, was I wrong!. Don't look at the title and dislike the movie because you have to see it! There was definitely original humor. Adults will adore this movie. Many scenes contained humor that actually made you laugh. I guess you could actually compare this movie to Shrek which was hailed everywhere. Jack Black was the perfect actor for the lead role. I think he should be in more kid movies. He wasn't his normal immature acting. He was serious, yet funny. The whole idea of Kung Fu Panda may seem a bit ""questionable"", but don't believe that. You HAVE to see this movie!",30 June 2008
Kung Fu Panda is a good movie,9,"I must admit I was a little skeptical going in to watch this movie, the main reason being, Dreamworks, in my opinion, has not produced a good movie since Shrek. By good movie I mean, a movie with a good story, heart, and humor. The Shrek sequels and other movies from the studio have all been corny and shallow, utilizing big name voices but with little in the manner of storyline and heart. Pixar, did exactly the opposite. Avoiding big names as much as they could except for where they felt it was necessary to help the storyline. Pixar put movie first, then voice actors. Dreamworks the reverse. And look at which company does better. Pixar of course! A good friend told me that Kung Fu Panda was 'friggin Awesome', so I decided to take a chance. The trailers looked interesting. A little different from Dreamworks' typical approach of touting voices and funny scenes. Kung Fu Panda does have its fair share of voices, with Angelina Jolie, Lucy Liu, and Dustin Hoffman. But the trailers did not focus on the voices at all, which led me to believe that this might be something new.So it started. I was mesmerized by the stylized opening sequence. I'm sure many an animator would take note of the work. It left me intrigued and interested. It also got me to smile and set me up for what was to come. The opening sequence is important. Make sure you don't get late and miss it.The movie then switches into the normal style of 3D animation that we have become so familiar with in recent years. Kung Fu Panda has a lot of talking animals in it, and no humans at all. Jack Black plays Po, the Panda, who works in a noodle shop assisting his father (a goose?). He dreams of learning Kung Fu, and is a big fan of the fearsome five, a group of five animals who are experts within their animal talents. He is a true fan boy, and owns action figures of each of them. The story unfolds in a way that is not too unexpected. Po, our unlikely lovable hero, has to eventually defeat Tai Lung, and save everyone.Interestingly, I found that the style of story had some similarities to Chinese folklore. The storyline intentionally encompasses Chinese culture and tradition to a degree. A rare thing to behold. I loved the effort.Kung Fu Panda will appeal to all ages. For the young, the motivational message that comes towards the end. And for the older, an enchanting work of great entertainment. I was entertained.Kung Fu Panda is a good movie, and is reminiscent of the days when Dreamworks came up with Shrek. Now go see it and enjoy yourself!",19 June 2008
Definitely worth the wait,8,"This animation i have to say is one of the best i've seen and i'm not a fan of pixar type 3D animation (ie Find Nemo, Shrek etc...) since they're too much for kids. But this animation is worth the hype and the wait. Not only is it entertaining/funny but also has a moral to the story which we all should learn from (both adults and children).The graphics is excellent, story is simple/typical (aren't majority of them nowadays) but the moral included makes this animation not only for kids but for everyone.Generally i don't want any sequels to be made since they are just for money grabbing reasons but for this one i hope they make a trilogy since i really LOVE PO.",18 June 2008
Jack Black and his AWESOMENES!!!,9,"Well if your looking for a good time this movie is definitely for you..The animation, CGI is done so well that even if I'm 20 i feel like an 8 year old watching a movie.The humor made me laugh but more than that there was meaning and depth into the dialogue which makes this film a classic. The voice of Jack Black paired up well with Po the Panda giving the movie a genuine feel.""There are no accidents"" And me giving this movie a 9 ain't no accident! ENJOY!!",18 June 2008
Spectacular Movie!,10,"Kung Fu Panda is one of the best animation movie I have ever seen. It has excellent animation; everything seems so realistic. The voice for the characters were a perfect match for in the movie. Throughout the movie, there are many scenes where you laugh until you can't anymore.The story line was pretty good. It is just like any other animation movie. The only thing that sets this movie different from others is the laughter, adventure, and kung fu style.This is a great family movie, but I suggest about letting little kids watching it because of the kung fu, action fighting thing. Other than that, its a great movie for kids and adults too. You'll love it until the end and will want to watch it again. It will definitely be worth your while.",12 June 2008
Panderous Fun!,8,"(In the style of the 70's disco hit song ""Kung Fu Fighting"")Everybody is watching ""Kung Fu Panda"" That fat panda is getting many sightings Even though at the start the Kung Fun Panda is not a little bit frightening He comes through with expert timing There were funky animated characters again From funky Paramount Animation town They were drawing them up and they were drawing them down It's an ancient Movie art and every Panda creator knew their part From drawing the Panda slips and see him kicking from his gut-covered hipEverybody will love ""Kung Fu Panda"" Jack Black was great as Panda Even though the Black was not a little bit frightening But he delivered laughs with expert timing There was a funky master Shifu with his Furious Fighting Five There comes a villain tiger Tai Lung, he gets it on I took and bow and made a stand, started clapping with my hands The vocal motion from these actors made me trip, and now we're into these film stripsAll the vocal acting was great in ""Kung Fu Panda"" Dustin Hoffman's voice work as Shifu was very delighting Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Seth Rogen, David Cross, and Lucy Liu were also striking as the Furious Five and even Ian McShane as Tai Lung was also wonderfully frighteningEverybody should see ""Kung Fun Panda"" Go as fast as lightning Because the theatres are getting packed and is a many people sighting (End of song)I know this review has been a little frightening, but I hope it brought you some laughs with extra smiling.

Excellent movie!,10,"I found this movie to have a perfect combination of humor, hilarious situations and great graphics. I've seen it several times already, I still laugh during the movie, even though I know what to expect. It's just too funny not to laugh! It's one of those movies you can switch to if you don't like the movie you're watching. A guaranteed 1.5 hours of laughter! It deserves a 9+ rating, at least. It's difficult to envision what kind of person would not enjoy this film. Most of the good jokes require some mental abilities, so I assume somebody with a low IQ will not find this movie too interesting (hence the < 8 ratings?). It's smart, it's funny, it's awesome!If you enjoyed Madagascar, Shrek, Surf's Up or Happy Feet, you will love Kung Fu Panda!",2 July 2008
Great Film for All,10,"I was ready to see this film and anticipating it for months, and it delivered. Although some will say that it could have been funnier, I was pleased and laughed hard throughout. It is full of great voice talents that make the characters shine; even characters that are only there for a small amount of time.In the first two minutes of the film there is a dream sequence that is laugh out loud hysterical! I was practically crying; and turned to my friend to tell her, ""That was worth the price of admission, alone."" Jack Black makes a great voice and really brings the fat panda to life. He has just the right amount of comic relief and seriousness to make you connect with his character and really believe in him.Everyone I was with laughed hard and left with a smile on their face. I will definitely put this one in my list of movies to buy on DVD.",10 June 2008
"Kung Fu Panda is a great animated film, but not just animated either",8,"I have to say before watching this movie and hearing the title I thought to myself that it has to be the dumbest name for a film ever. The film looked like it was going to suck judging from the trailers.But as it turned out after watching this I found myself engaged and interested in what was going on. This movie is a perfect example of never judge a book by it's cover. The story of the film was very simple yet it was funny, cute, charming, likable and it can be pretty serious at times.The Animation was very impressive and colorful, the facial expressions on the animals looked great and there movements on them were great to. The soundtrack was very good and the action scenes were very entertaining. The acting was good and the characters were all fun to watch. If i had to point any flaws to the film would be two things, the furious five while pretty cool didn't have many lines and it would've been nice to have more development from them. The bad guy Tai lung wasn't a terrible bad guy since he was a cool fighter and he had a good voice that fits him well, but he was underdeveloped and could've been better.Overall Kung Fu panda is a great film that teaches people that they can do anything in life if they put there minds to it no matter what flaws they have.",9 October 2016
"Jack Black's greatest role, and one of the best animated films of the last decade.",9,"""Kung Fu Panda"" hits all the right notes of a terrific animated movie: gorgeous artwork, engaging story and characters, and it's made for everyone - big and small.The titular character is Po (Jack Black), a roly-poly panda with over-sized ambitions to match his girth. Stuck in his workaday job as a noodle-pusher, Po's biggest dream is to be a kung fu master and join the Furious Five, China's legendary superhero team (Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, David Cross and Seth Rogen). Po is thrown headfirst into training when a prophecy names him the new Dragon Master, to the chagrin of the Five's master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman). Meanwhile, the imprisoned Tai Lung (Ian McShane) has escaped, lusting for vengeance against Shifu, his former master. As the nigh-unstoppable escapee approaches, everything rests on the unlikely Kung Fu Panda.Steeped in Chinese mysticism and showcasing the breathtaking mountainscapes of the Far East, ""Kung Fu Panda"" is a film that is impossible not to like. The frenetic action scenes come fast and furious, while the quiet moments are stocked with inspirational Chinese proverbs and characterization. Much of the humor - and there's plenty of it - centers around the comically overweight panda as he faces off against his kung fu superiors.And Jack Black has found the perfect character for his trademark brand of overwrought hyperactive comedy, which usually borders on obnoxious. But here, it completely fits with the Panda who won't quit. Po is full of heart (as is the film), and his boundless energy and need to reek of awesomeness just makes him one of the most likable characters I've ever seen.And the whole movie is just as likable. No, scratch that.Lovable.9/10",3 January 2012
"Fantastic Movie. Philosophical, Inspiring, Funny",9,"This movie is entertaining and well thought out in many levels. In the most reductive form, its the story of a Panda(an unfit animal for training Kung Fu?) who wants to be a Kung Fu fighter. The movie is about how he eventually gets there, and that he does against many odds in a very entertaining way. That is the inspiring part of the story.If you look a little bit more deeply, we see that the 5 animals that are currently training to be the dragon warrior are monkey, crane, tiger, snake and mantis. They are not chosen by co-incidence, but these are the famous five animal fighting styles taught in Kung Fu.When the funny panda goofs up and unwittingly puts himself in a spot where he gets picked for the dragon warrior, master Shifu is not thrilled, and he does not believe that the panda can be a dragon warrior, and he is determined to make the panda give up and leave. But wise Oogway has faith in his selection. Eventually, master Shifu has to accept the fact that he has to train the panda to be a dragon warrior and in that process Shifu has to relearn his teaching methods as well.After intense training the panda has proved he is worthy and gets to open the dragon scroll, and here is where it reaches a philosophical zenith. When he opens the dragon scroll, he is supposed to see something special that is supposed to give him an advantage over his enemy, and what he sees is an empty scroll with a reflection of his face! The message indirectly conveyed is to have faith in oneself or, that if you truly believe in yourself you could be special, i.e you could achieve the impossible! Panda learns this(the meaning of the scroll) only later when he tries to find out what makes his dad's soup so special!Everybody else (furious five and Shifu), see the scroll as well, but however, it was only the panda who figures out what the empty scroll means. He tries to explain to Tai-Lung as to what the meaning of the scroll is, Tai-Lung does not see the meaning and thinks he is being tricked which eventually leads to his own destruction!Some of the core philosophy behind Kung Fu, is drawn from Buddhism. I cant help drawing a parallel between a famous saying originating from Buddhism- it says ""Before Enlightenment chop wood carry water, after Enlightenment, chop wood carry water."" The difference is only in the frame of mind. Analogous to that, even here after seeing the dragon scroll, panda only had to change its frame of mind to be special.",29 December 2011
An all-star cast wasted on a mediocre script,,"Considering the amazing amount of talented actors involved in this movie I expected a lot more than what this film provided.There were comedic moments but not many laugh out loud ones. The 5 great warriors were very poorly utilized and not given nearly enough screen time, It was pretty lame that they hired great voice talent and followed up by giving them all only a couple of lines.There were 3 great actions scenes but the ending was so anti-climactic that none of them really saved the worth of the movie. The main villain Tai Lung and the story that surrounded him was interesting but once again poorly utilized, especially since the final fight of the movie was completely worthless.",28 July 2008
Unbelievably Irresponsible Movie,2,"Cartoons are typically targeted towards the younger audience. The impressionable minds, the sponges. So instead of making a movie which teaches that hard work, sustained commitment, discipline and patience ultimately pays off, here, we have the exact opposite. The team who has spent a lifetime preparing for a task is pushed aside in favor of a wholly unmotivated, ill-prepared, unqualified on all accounts ""hero"", who is chosen by destiny (which fairy tale could do without it ?) and conveyed through a turtle, who is about to kick the bucket himself.In matter of two days, a panda who is so overweight that he literally cannot get up, and could (or should) keel over from a massive stroke or a heart-attack any minute, is sharpened into a Master Kung-Fu fighter through a program of --consuming chicken dumplings.It's a frightening message for the younger generation: That unqualified and unprepared triumphs over the qualified and prepared, by goofing off. Panda has no inherent special powers in him. No gifts are bestowed upon him to make him special. He just becomes special because he believes he's special. Wow.I will say that there is nothing visually wrong in the way this movie is put together. The animation, direction and voice overs are all first-rate. My beef is with the central premise of the movie, which is why, I feel, kids should not be exposed to it.",9 January 2010
Can you handle the crazy feet?Kung Fu Panda,7,"Pixar is where it is at for me animation-wise in Hollywood. Maybe that makes me a snob, but something about their films resonant on a level that the others can't even begin to touch. Sure Shrek and Madagascar are funny, but besides the off-belly laugh, they are kind of shallow and hollow. With that said, I went to check out Dreamworks new foray into computer graphic cinema, Kung Fu Panda. Admittedly, I knew very little about this thing other than the fact that Jack Black and Angelina Jolie voiced characters. It could possibly be due to the fact that I don't watch much TV, but I've seen sparse promotion at best until walking into the theatre and seeing a giant 3D panda in the lobby. On the whole, the film plays out much like you'd want a family/kid friendly picture to. We are given examples of friendship, belief in oneself, and humilityall life lessons we hope to inspire our youth with. With a good backbone such as that, along with some humorous bits and stunning action choreography, this panda definitely packs a punch doing his job: entertaining the audience right until the final frame.Credit the producers for compiling a top-notch roster of vocal talent to enhance the somewhat ho-hum script. These types of movies are never very original, so it takes a bit of extra panache to really draw me in. Black is actually quite good in the role and Po the panda plays right into his schtick. When arriving at the hall of warriors, he goes to every artifact and does his thing, screaming his excitement at all the cool stuff like it's his JB character from Tenacious D eying Jimi Hendrix's first guitar. The Kung Fu arm mannerisms even recall his air guitar/rock n' roll motions. Black is somewhat restrained and his manic energy is reigned in to be effective on the comedic and dramatic levels. This guy is, after all, our entrance into the story and the character we are supposed to relate to. An outcast and an original, we all can see a bit of ourselves, always dreaming but never taking the leap to achieve those goals. We watch his evolution and start to believe that it could happen to us too.It is a fine line for the supporting roles. A Panda with historical knowledge of the ancient art yet without any actual experience has been proclaimed the savior of the valley against a monster of a foe. He is truly the ugly duckling and all those around him must straddle the division of chiding him and the absurdity of the situation, but not be too meanthere are kids watching. In order to keep a good grasp on this tenuous situation, the filmmakers cast a group of affable people with the ability to work in serious moments, but never relinquish the humorous edge to their voice. Guys like David Cross, Seth Rogen, and Jackie Chan are perfect for the roles of the true warriors attempting to reconcile their preconceptions of this screw-up swooping in and taking their thunder. Moments like the acupuncture scene really show this to be true. Jolie is good as Tigress, another fighter and prize student, but the role ends up being pretty forgettable and by the books. She never really gets the range to go crazy. Neither does Dustin Hoffman as the master and teacher to them all, yet he is a still a success. My favorite supporter was the great Ian McShane as Tai Lung, the villain of the tale. No one has a better voice for nefarious deeds than this guy and he delivers continuously.As far as the story goes, it is a nice tale to teach the kids about faith and comradery. For us older folk, however, we are treated with some spectacular action/battle sequences to satisfy our want for more than just preaching. The chopstick fight between Hoffman and Black is fantastic, having comedy and tenacity with some nice artwork and fast paced movement. The battle on a rope bridge towards the end, as well as the final confrontation, is also highly enjoyable. Credit the entertainment to the acting and a gimmick that at first made me cringe. Throughout the film we are treated with slow-motion insertions during the action. A nod to old Kung Fu films and the satirical spoofs created as a result, I was thinking I'd grow tired of the maneuver very fast. Fortunately, as the movie continues on, the moments become sprinkled in with perfect timing. The escape from Rhino prison wouldn't have been half as fun without the speed changes in the action and the slow-mo facial expressions of those getting thrown around. Even towards the end, the filmmakers began to use it as an original comedic device. Capturing Po's reaction to a charging Tai Lung is absolutely priceless.Kung Fu Panda is by no means a masterpiece, but for a cartoon that really flew under my radar, I had a lot of fun taking part in the experience. Right from the beginning, with a stylized 2D rendered sequence as an introduction, I saw that this wouldn't be quite the run-of-the-mill work I was anticipating. Always staying fresh and funny I can fully endorse anyone wanting to check it out as a nice appetizer to what could be a fantastic main course in Pixar's Wall-E come this summer.",31 May 2008
A bad ending spoils this otherwise enjoyable film.,6,"Po is a panda (voiced by Jack Black) who dreams of being a kung fu master; however, being a little on the large side and just a waiter in a noodle shop, the chances of him realising this fantasy seem relatively small. But when Po leaves work to witness the selection of the Dragon Warrior (the mighty martial artist who is destined to save the valley from dreadful danger), he somehow finds himself chosen for the position.Now, with only days before the arrival of the villainous Tai Lung, a powerful snow leopard with destruction on his mind, can Po learn the secrets of kung fu in time and become the hero he so desperately wishes to be?Although Kung Fu Panda has a lot going for itcool animation, great characters and some wonderful gags (which work particularly well if you're a fan of martial arts movies) I'm going to go against what seems to be the general consensus, and declare that I thought the ending sucked, and spoilt what might have been an otherwise excellent adventure.Following loads of wonderful action, plenty of laughs, and some mystical mumbo-jumbo about a magical scroll that contains the secret of unimaginable power, Kung Fu Panda turns into a weak morality tale, preaching that real strength comes from belief in oneself. Whilst I think that being confident and comfortable with who you are is a wonderful sentiment, I do think that a positive mental attitude only gets you so far, and that the mighty rhino-bashing Tai Lung would've torn Po a new one! End of.Some fans argue that Po used his weaknesses (ie., his fat) to his advantage, deflecting his enemy's more powerful moves; others say that after Tai Lung realised that he could not improve his powers through the use of the Dragon Scroll, he lost his confidence. I say 'hogwash!'.Tai Lung was a highly trained juggernaut of rage who easily fought his way past guards twice as bulky as Po and defeated five of the best warriors in the country (does that sound like someone lacking confidence to you? I don't think so). Po should have been turned into panda paste.Of course, there is the theory that once Po worked out that he all he needed to do was be himself, he finally realised his destiny and became the fabled Dragon Warrior. If this is the case, then it's a lame, wishy-washy idea that isn't explained very well .Either way, the ending spoils the film. And that's a real shame.5.5 out of 10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.",21 July 2008
An entertaining summer flick!,8,"Another highly entertaining flick from Dreamworks. Jack Black played a clumsy fat Panda to great effect, and was nicely complimented by the other animal characters. The story was very predictable, but the animation, pacing and great action made up for it. I loved the action sequences, particularly those involving the villain. Out of them all, the 'escape' was probably my favorite sequence.Though I wouldn't call it a classic, as it lacked the emotional touch of 'Nemo' & Lion King etc, it is entertaining for adults and kids alike, though it kinda seemed a little violent for kids (but then who really cares these days!).",19 June 2008
Feel the Thunder!,8,"From the time I was a little one to now, I have always loved movies and anything else with an Asian flair. From Mulan to Samurai Champloo, Asia's rich and interesting culture have always been in my must-have book, and I have loved them since childhood. Kung-Fu Panda takes an interesting look at this genre, as well as a modern one.Po, a chubby, yet lovable Panda (Jack Black) works in a noodle shop with his Goose father (David Hong), but dreams of Kung-Fu and fighting with the Fearsome Five, a team made up of Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Viper (Lucy Liu), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Crane (David Cross) and Mantis (Seth Rogen). When the old turtle sage Oogway announces a tournament for the selection of the Dragon Warrior, Po tries to attend, but, because of late arrival, is shut out. When he falls into the stadium after another failed attempt to get in, he is unwittingly selected as the warrior. Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) is now faced with the task of training a panda with great knowledge but little skill in Kung-Fu. Meanwhile, the evil Tai Long (Ian MacShane) has escaped from prison, and is now threatening the village. Can Po live up to his new title and the dreams that keep him going? When the film was advertised, I became very interested. Seeing promo after promo peaked it. When I read the article on this film from USA today, I was surprised to see that a number of adults had gone to see it in the opening weekend! I figured, that's good enough for me, so I got my mom to take me to the theater to see it...and absolutely loved it. It is probably the best film from Dreamworks yet. The characters are what really draw you into the movie and the action/fighting sequences are expertly timed. The voice cast is perfectly cast. Jack Black plays our furry, chubby, kung-fu loving hero Po. Angelina Jolie is the bad-ass tigress who, although brash and thinks Po is a joke at first, is brave and learns to trust in her new comrade. Dustin Hoffman, Jackie Chan, Michael Clarke Duncan and Lucy Liu also round out the cast. The effects and animation also make the movie a must see!",11 June 2008
Not Just a Great Animated Movie- A Great Movie . . . Period!,9,"I was very entertained by ""Kung-Fu Panda"". This movie ranks among Dreamworks Animation's best along with ""Shrek"", ""Shrek II"", and ""Antz"". The animation as a whole was excellent, including the fantasy sequences that took the form of supposed 2D animation. Even when the animation was 3D, the animation had everything down to a T from the blades of grass to roof shingles to animal's fur.Of course, since 3D has now become the norm for animated movies, I know that 3D animation alone cannot save a movie. For instance, ""Doogal"", ""Shrek The Third"", and ""Shark Tale"" (which also featured the voices of Jack Black and Angelina Jolie) were big disappointments for me. Fortunately, there was enough good comedy, great action sequences, and intriguing characters to keep me entertained and to rate this movie as the best to come out of this summer so far.For starters, Jack Black was perfect as Po the Panda. In my opinion, Black was underused in ""Shark Tale"", which was probably why I didn't like that movie so much. Here, he brings his great comic timing and a touch of his Tenacious D personality into this panda character. He especially works very well in the training sequences with Head Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman). I thought it odd that his character was the only panda in a story set in China, but I won't get too picky.The actors who played the Furious Five were also well cast. Angelina Jolie was a natural to play Tigress, who is probably the first truly strong female character in animation history who also isn't involved in a love story subplot of a film. I actually found myself relieved that they left such a subplot out and just concentrated on a great story.If I have one complaint against the movie, it's that the other four fighters weren't as focused on as they should have been. Yes, there's only so much you can fit into a 90 minute movie, but the snake (Lucy Liu), crane (David Cross), praying mantis (Seth Rogen), and monkey (Jackie Chan) all individually made such intriguing characters. Indeed, this is one of the few animated movies I've seen that merits a sequel, and I hope that all four of them are focused on in that other movie should it come along.Otherwise, that's my only complaint against the movie. It just worked so well otherwise. Other than the mostly American voice-overs, the movie stayed true to a traditional Kung Fu movie by the likes of Bruce Lee and Sonny Chiba, and also had elements of spaghetti westerns and other movies such as ""Star Wars"". None of that would have been complete with a great Darth Vader-esquire villain like leopard Tai Ling (played by lesser known actor Ian McShane), and an even better Yoda-esquire mentor like tortoise Ancient Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim). This is an altogether incredible movie that I personally can't wait to purchase on DVD. I may even see it again in theaters, and there are few movies that make me want to do that.",11 June 2008
"With dazzlingly animated fight scenes and the likable panda Po, I found this very entertaining.",,"I saw this with a friend at a preview screening last Sat and I was worried it might be like the other forgettable mass-produced animated films, but I was pleasantly surprised.The voice acting was pretty flawless. This is a very good case of finding the actors(even if they are all well recognised stars) that fit that characters well. I couldn't imagine anyone else voicing Po apart from Jack Black - he just seems to completely embody Po's personality and humour. Jolie also has the severity of her character Tigress while the standout being Hoffman conveys Shifu's exasperation and everything else as the panda's master.Pacing and Plot: OK, so the plot is probably borrowed form numerous sources but it does have a classic storytelling feel to it, and there are certain parts that don't happen(especially during the climax) exactly the way you expect. Slightly clichéd, but charming and entertaining enough to overcome it, I think.Animation: The opening 2D sequence is nothing short of amazing, in my opinion. The fight scenes and Tai Lung's escape is just stunning to behold - both witty and a feast for the eyes. This coupled with the subtle character animation that brings them to life might be overlooked since the masses are probably used to it due to the load of animated films that come out, but it's really well done.Music: This is where I take my hat off - there are no of those stupid, generic pop songs playing during the film! Thank God! The music is very good, from the orchestral parts I heard and does give one a sense of being in China.Overall, there are some things not explained(like why Po's dad is a duck and Po's past) but apart from niggles with lack of originality story-wise and some clichés, this is really an experience to enjoy fully in a cinema I think, due to the sheer scope of the fight sequences and the cinematography of old China. It has it's quite funny scenes and even if it's not funny all the way through exactly, it has a heart, which is always important to me - it raises it from just flash to having some substance. A very good animated film from Dreamworks and even if the forthcoming sequel isn't as good, this'll be one for me, to enjoy again and again when it arrives on DVD.",3 July 2008
Kung Fu Panda,9,"Kung Fu Panda Rated: PG Time: 1:31 Stars: The voices of such notables as: Dustin Hoffman, Jack Black, Lucy Liu, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan and others Final Grade: B+ Overview Summary: This is an animated story of a fat panda, that in his dreams longs to be a kung fu hero, being thrust into his role in destiny to save his village and valley from an ancient and evil foe. If kung fu fight scenes bother you, be aware that there's lots of kung fu action (which some chose to avoid - so fair warning) as well as lots of laughs and action for both kids and parents alike.This is a family oriented movie, given the fighting scenes, and my family and kid really enjoyed it.The final moral of the story is that the secret to true greatness is found inside of one's self and that you can achieve the greatness you seek if you want it...but a lot more than that happens in the hour and 31 minutes that this film runs.Now The Details: Our movie opens with a fat lazy panda dreaming of being a great kung fu warrior and saving the world from the throws of evil through his fighting skills and those of the other major fighting skills personified by the crane, snake, monkey and in this case tigress. He then wakes up to the reality of his own peasant life in the family business.But, as his luck would have it, there's a contest in the village to determine the warrior who will be chosen to defend everyone from a recently escaped evil villain.By a most humorous stroke of luck, our hero to be is chosen to be the one to defend the village from the evil one. Needless to say, he's as shocked as the heir apparents' are.There's some good laughs and moments during his rushed training and acclimation to the rest of the group and alas his time to prove himself comes through as he and the bad guy square off to fight over who gets the golden scroll with the all powerful secret message inside.You can basically guess who wins but what's interesting is that, at the end, the moral that a person's inner self is what determines their own success and that you can do and be whatever down inside you set you r mind's goals to be.This movie is clocked full of animated action and fighting scenes, lots of humor and 1:31 of family fun.Enjoy this one with the family and the kids may be talking about it for days.And that's the I saw it, From Where I Stand.( The writer is a regular contributor to www.fromwhereistand.info )",28 June 2008
Kung Fu Panda destined to become a classic,9,"Went to see Kung Fu Panda on Saturday with very high expectations and I wasn't disappointed in fact, it was better than I thought. I was funny and it has a lot of action and adventure. It is also a movie that leaves you some valuable learning like ""never give up"" and ""always believe in yourself"". A very good story about an Enthusiastic, big and a little clumsy, Po is the biggest fan of kung fu around which doesn't exactly come in handy while working every day in his family's noodle shop. Unexpectedly chosen to fulfill an ancient prophecy, Po's dreams become reality when he joins the world of kung fu and studies alongside his idols, the legendary Furious Five--Tigress, Crane, Mantis, Viper and Monkey--under the leadership of their guru, Master Shifu. But before they know it, the vengeful and treacherous snow leopard Tai Lung is headed their way, and it's up to Po to defend everyone from the oncoming threat. It is like a tribute to all those Chinese kung fu movies. The cast of voices is excellent, Jack Black, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, Dustin Hoffman, Seth Rogen and Michael Clark Duncan all with awesome performances. In conclusion, this is one of the best movie of the season and the best animated DreamWorks movie since Shrek 2.",25 June 2008
A Lot Better Than Expected!,8,"I hate talking animal movies and CGI movies so when you put those two together, it's usually a pretty bad combination for me. There have been a few exceptions like most of Disney/Pixar's films and now, Kung Fu Panda. I'm a big fan of kung fu movies and I think most fans will enjoy this movie because it seems to have been made specifically for those people.The story and actually quite good and has a lot of heart. There are some really great action sequences, as well and they really captured the kung fu feel with this movie. I also thought the visuals were great which is rare, at least to me, in a CGI film. There are a lot of very good things about this film that almost everyone should enjoy.Kung fu fans probably won't be disappointed with this one as I had a blast with it. I was expecting total garbage and actually am happy that I saw it. I'll be picking up the DVD when it comes out.",22 June 2008
"Truly wonderful, a masterpiece for kids and adults",9,"Kung Fu Panda is a remarkable film. From the horrid title, you go into the movie expecting some cheap rip off of the Jackie Chan movies. But only a short ways into Kung Fu Panda, you realize that it is a truly beautiful and well done movie. It mixes smart (and yes, sometimes stupid) humor with beautiful rendered and artistically proficient scenes.Still, the plot (more so ""theme) is atypical for the genre (the old ""underdog"" theme), and the movie at times seems like it wants to fall back upon overused animated movie tools. But this should not deter you at all from the movie. It's stunning in every aspect.The voice acting? Incredible. Jack Black is truly wonderful as Po, and all of the other actors do a superb job (Angelina Jolie was Master Tigress?! I didn't even know that until the credits.). Sadly, the only character that sounds truly Chinese is the Monkey (voiced by Jackie Chan. You cannot make a good kung-fu movie without him).Music? Lets just shorten this by saying it deserves an Oscar nomination (or winning *hint hint*) Now I HAVE to wrap up this by writing about oogways death scene. I am truly amazed to say I cried over a dead turtle. And I don't even cry at the end of sad movies! But the pure beauty of this scene is just so moving, even the hardest heart will soften. The music is very wonderful (although I will say I'm glad they refrained the catchy, but god awful ""kung fu fighting"" song to the credits).Go and see it. You'll see it more than once.You must believe.",20 June 2008
Terrific Kung Fu Epic For the Whole Family,8,"After churning out mostly mediocre or rubbish animated films for years (SHARK TALE, the SHREK sequels, MADAGASCAR, BEE MOVIE), Dreamworks finally manages to release a piece that gets everything right from start to finish. It's apparent from the film's opening frame that a lot of care and thought went into the making of the delightful KUNG FU PANDA, and while the story is certainly nothing new  especially to those of us who live and breathe martial arts flicks  , it tells a familiar tale with a great deal of heart, enthusiasm, and respect for the viewer's intelligence while completely eschewing the anachronistic and largely inappropriate pop culture jokes that worked in the first SHREK and nowhere else since.Po (voiced by Jack Black) is the fat son of a noodle chef who, though being groomed to take over the family business, has dreams of one day becoming a great kung fu master and hero of the people, but while quite game and enthusiast, he's lazy, clumsy, and has no skills whatsoever. The unlikely wannabe gets his shot at glory when the prophesied escape of the villainous and incredibly skilled Tai Lung (DEADWOOD's Ian McShane) looms imminent and a martial arts master must be named as the sacred Dragon Warrior in order to handle the threat. Po, quite by accident, finds himself awarded the vaunted title, much to the horror and dismay of the diminutive Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) and his balls-out badassed students, the Furious Five, each representing an embodiment of a classical animal-based kung fu style (specifically tiger, mantis, crane, snake, and monkey). All are dumbfounded that a fat load like Po could be the Dragon Warrior and all are at first determined to make sure that he gives up and leaves the temple, but they didn't expect Po's genuine love of what they do to fuel him to give it his best shot. While he's pretty much a washout, Po's girth and enjoyment of his training work to his advantage, and Master Shifu figures out just how to motivate his unwanted new student to greatness, all while his adopted daughter, Master Tigress (Angelina Jolie), seethes at the role that should have gone to her is usurped by one she feels is unworthy. As Tai Lung approaches and Po leaves the temple to accompany his father as the local villagers evacuate before the coming martial apocalypse, the Furious Five advance to stop him, but are unceremoniously handed their asses in a butt-kicking of painfully disheartening proportions. When Master Shifu, no slouch himself, proves unable to defeat Tai Lung  who, by the way, is also his adoptive child, one in whom he is deeply disappointed because he turned to evil  , Po returns to save the day after reaching a philosophical epiphany unwittingly provided by his noodle chef dad, providing the ages-old lesson of ""believe in yourself, and you can achieve miracles"" for a new generation of movie-going little ones.I would have had a great time with KUNG FU PANDA even had I not been a devotee to the martial arts, so I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a fun ""hero's journey"" or training film (a la the Shaw Brothers classic MASTER KILLER), as well as advising lovers of quality animation to see this on the big screen in order to get the full effect of its visual grandeur. As for the individual points of note:* The one element of the film that I feared would make or break the film turned out to be quite praiseworthy, namely Jack Black's voice acting. I loved Black in the excellent SCHOOL OF ROCK, but find him mostly annoying in just about everything else he's been in because his approach to comedy often strikes me like he's both trying too hard and is attempting to convince everyone watching that he's as funny as he thinks he is. This time, though, he gives a genuine performance that is full of heart and charm, and the viewer definitely comes to love and root for his character.* Dustin Hoffman was the last person I would have expected to be able to pull of playing that mainstay of kung fu movies, the seasoned master, but he's absolutely perfect as Shifu, a character whose triumphant martial abilities are reflected in Tai Lung's misuse of his teachings, and Master Tigress' feelings of resentment at being passed over as the Dragon Warrior. Shifu conveys as weary exasperation and sadness seldom seen in a character of this type, and I find him much more interesting than many of the master types found in the literally hundreds of martial arts films that I've seen. He's no Simon Yeung, or even Keye Luke for that matter, but he's nonetheless terrific.* And speaking of terrific master types, Randall Duk Kim's ancient Master Oogway is the finest of this breed since Yoda first showed up in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (1980), before his mystery and wonder were permanently flushed down the toilet in the cinematic Montezuma's Revenge that was STAR WARS: EPISODES I-III. This centered, contemplative figure is a tortoise who's every slow movement conveys both his advanced age and now effortless mastery of his art, as well as his wisdom and connection with the natural world around him. He's even Shifu's master, and Shifu defers to his decree when Oogway pronounces Po to be the Dragon Warrior; Shifu has his doubts about that, but in the end Oogway is proved right beyond the shadow of a doubt. Truly beautiful in every way, I wish Oogway had more screen time.So don't wait for KUNG FU PANDA to hit DVD or cable. Go see its plethora of visual storytelling wonders on the big screen as it was intended, and I highly doubt you'll be disappointed.",16 June 2008
THE Big Funny Panda,8,"Fortune cookie wisdom is imparted throughout the colorful KUNG FU PANDA. Some of it makes no sense out of context but it all amounts to some very simple, very basic advice about believing in the warrior within. ""There are no accidents,"" claims the coolest of Zen master turtles after a panda drops from the sky at just the right moment to be deemed the next Dragon Warrior. There are especially no accidents when no risk is taken. That panda is of course the panda from the title and from the moment this lazy emotional eater is ""discovered"" as the warrior that will go on to save the kingdom, you know exactly how the entire thing will play out. Po (voiced by an increasingly subtle Jack Black) will drown in doubt while he trains for something he doesn't believe himself capable of; the other animals will badger him into giving up; but eventually, he will find his inner kung fu master and save the day. Subsequently and expectedly, reviewers will call it out for its lack of originality. That's how it goes.So it isn't so original. No big deal. What it lacks in originality, it makes up for in style and humour. Relatively new directors, Mark Osborne and John Stevenson have created a multihued ancient China that moves with stealth precision between enchantment and explosive energy. Its inhabitants are geese and rabbits that live their lives in the shadow of lore. As long as all is peaceful, then they can blissfully enjoy their noodle soups in the town square and if anything should happen to collapse that peace, then they have the kung fu specialized Furious Five  a tiger, a monkey, a crane, a snake and oddly enough, a mantis  to protect them from whatever evil lurks. No one member of the community has more faith in these five than Po. His idolatry of these heroes extends to numerous posters on his walls and action figures by his bed. Black plays Po as the hardcore geek that hides his enthusiasm and secret desire to be a part of it all in fear of being ridiculed for wanting the impossible. Po is that unfortunate fat kid from school that wants to hang with all the cool kids, hates that he's stuck working at the local fast food joint after school and knows that there's nothing he can do about it. Wait; was I that kid? Is that why I love him?KUNG FU PANDA is overloaded with voice talent. Any scene with Po is usually hilarious as I guess Black knows what it's like to be the unlikely guy hanging with the in crowd. However, when he isn't in the picture, the delivery from the majority of the A-list cast is often bland and purely functional. Po, and his kung fu trainer, Shifu (a frustrated and disgruntled, yet still minutely optimistic Dustin Hoffman) trade quips with fervor and weight and make for much giddiness. The Furious Five, not so much. Considering they're voiced by actors as varied as Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan and Seth Rogen, you would think they would provide for plenty of conflicting antics but they end up reduced to nothing more than another obstacle for Po to overcome. I'm no kung fu expert but I'm pretty sure gossiping and bad mouthing members of the team when they aren't there (and sometimes even when they're right in front of them) is not part of the package. Our heroes aren't always what we hope they will be when we finally find ourselves face to face with them but these five could have certainly been truer to their furious form if some element of development had been given to them.Still, despite its unevenness and seemingly simple approach, KUNG FU PANDA is great wisdom wrapped in even greater fun and often breathtaking animation. Sometimes the simplest of lessons are the ones that are hardest to learn. (Now I'm a fortune cookie.) Perhaps the subtlest lesson the film passes on is to relinquish your control over the destiny of your own life. Po never thought he would find himself surrounded by his heroes, getting the chance to realize his life long dream of becoming a kung fu master but here he is suddenly. Master Shifu never thought he would be training such a useless lump but here his is as well. It is only when each character let go of their egos and expectations that they saw how to make their situation work. Shedding your own expectation for KUNG FU PANDA to be something more than what it really is will allow for the good times intended to be had and an unexpected tranquility to seep into your mind.",8 June 2008
beautiful but slightly disappointing,6,"I saw KFP last night and i when i left the theatre, there was a weird feeling in my stomach. That feeling was disappointment due to the lack of laughter. I watched the entire movie with a smile on my face, so it was enjoyable but not hysterical, i never broke out in laughter like i did with other animated movies.This movie has something special and that is the magnificent animation and the spectacular fight scenes, that will remind you of ""crouching tiger,hidden dragon"" and ""house of flying daggers"".I went to see it with a friend of mine and we both love movies. Afterwards we love to discuss what we saw and re-enjoy the best moments, but you could have heard a pin drop. We couldn't find anything to mention that was memorable to say besides our admiration for the beauty and eastern style the movie was crafted in.So in conclusion: If you want to see an animated Kungfu-film, KFP is great. If you expect to see a funny picture about a panda doing Kungfu , KFP is very mediocre. 6/10 (the great fighting and lack of comedy)",23 July 2008
WOW!!! Awesome movie!!,9,"This movie was incredible the story was great the animation was awesome.I own a karate school and we had a preview tonight 2 days before it hits theaters and it was absolutely awesome!!!!! The kids had a great time, the adults loved it!! This movie will become an instant classic like shrek and others in that class!!! The comedic timing was really good and pertained only to the movie. No weird out of the film references, no really bad martial arts movie genre pieces put in. The comedy is slap stick based but that is what appeals to most kids and this is a kids movie per say.Anyone who is a martial arts flick buff will love this young or old!Only thing that leaves to be desired that prevents it from being a 10 is character development on the furious 5..... however the character development of the masters, PO and the bad guy tai lung was excellent!",4 June 2008
"Weak, but well made for kids",6,"When one goes to see a movie of this nature, it is expected that they will compare it to its peers; Finding Nemo etc. However, I cannot even come close to putting this movie in the same category as Finding Nemo when it comes to ratings. Let me explain.Kung Fu Panda is an easy 92 minutes, that will not only leave children in hysterics at the good clean humour, but will not leave you fuming at Dreamworks for taking another hour and a half of your life. Jack Black brings a full blown feast of his personality to the table, and Dustin Hoffman does a stellar job as the diminutive kung fu master. Jolie, Liu and Chan hardly feature in this star studded cast. The animation is as good as you expect these days, and the pace of the movie doesn't let anything to be desired.However, I do have a few bones to pick with this film. One can go see Toy Story and be captured by the notion of figurines coming to life while the human beings are away, or see Finding Nemo and be content with the assumption that all the beings of the ocean can talk to each other - while they still live in sea anemones etc. These movies thrive on these settings to aid and progress the plot of the movie. One has to wonder watching Kung Fu Panda, was there any other point to personifying these animals other than to play on our feelings as to what is 'cute', and sell movie tickets to parents with children? There were little, if any, jokes for older generations, whilst the plot line was nothing but your typical underdog story. In the end, one is reminded to believe in one's self etc... blah blah blah. This is apart from the many many many MANY continuity errors that might or might not irritate you.So, for the performances by Jack Black and Hoffman, as well the great animation and value for young children in the silly humour, I can give it a 6/10. As far as movies go, this does not measure up as much as other movies in its class, and certainly not as much as other movies in general, and I believe that more care was needed to take this good movie and make it a great one.Strongly recommended for children and bored adults who think it's cute and funny to see a fat panda try to do Kung Fu - no doubt there will be many of you.",16 July 2008
Dreamworks should be Proud,10,"After the garbage that was Shrek 3, Over the Hedge, and SharkTale, and the only mediocre Madagascar, when I saw the preview for Dreamwork's newest film Kung Fu Panda, I laughed at the stupidity of a movie involving an overweight Panda trying to become a kung fu master. Eventually my sister dragged me to see it with her, where I discovered just how sorely wrong I was.Not only is Kung Fu Panda visually appealing - the animation and scenery is breathtakingly beautiful - well written - you'll find a deeper and more engaging story here than merely a Panda trying to master martial arts - and hilarious - there are a multitude of hysterical jokes, which astonishingly are nearly all kid-friendly - but it manages to grasp what other Dreamworks films cannot even attempt: a heart. The fight scene between the awesome master Shifu and the truly evil Tai Lung doesn't only work because of the fantastic animation and the dramatic music, but because of the background story that was worked into it. The secret of the dragon scroll was so heartwarming that even the harshest critic will be touched. Po, instead of being rude and arrogant like I expected, was lovable and his longing to reach his goal is something all of us can identify with. The Furious Five's gradual acceptance of and friendship with Po was sweet and Shifu is perhaps the best-developed character in Dreamworks history. His quest for inner peace and the troubling relationship with Tai Lung in his past lead to some extremely emotional scenes. Even the end credits and the touching scene that follows them are wonderfully visually appealing.Some people are saying that they don't like this movie, because it supposedly glorifies obesity and stupidity. I say they must have gone to the movie theater wearing blindfolds and earplugs. Po didn't succeed in facing Tai Lung because of his weight; he succeeded because he believed in himself! This movie teaches us that we are all special and loved regardless of size, body shape or race, something important we should really be teaching our future generations.So all in all, go and see Kung Fu Panda! It's right up there with Pixar's finest like Finding Nemo and will be a film the whole family will love!",3 July 2008
'Panda' is Peerless,9,"In recent years Dreamworks animation has been a sort of hit and miss production company. Some of their films have been nearly as good as the Pixar films (Shreks, Over the Hedge), but others have been close to complete crap (Shark Tale, Madagascar, Bee Movie). With 'Kung Fu Panda' Dreamworks hits the jackpot.The film is great because of how simple it is. Simple story, simple morals, simple (but very effective) comedy, and simple style. The movie is just good to watch. You could go and see it with your family, or your best friends---its a neutral sort of movie.Jack Black was the by far the best choice for the main character, Po, and you REALLY get a sense of the real Jack Black. He is such a passionate soul in most of his movies---this is especially highlighted in 'Panda.' Apart from having a simple and intriguing story, the movie has some legit fight scenes. Scenes that could only be made with animals shown in the film.Honestly, this is a great movie. If you want to feel good about going to see a movie by yourself, with friends, family, a girlfriend, boyfriend, whatever---truly, this is a great choice. DO NOT think this movie is just for kids, because it really is not.All in all, the movie is a clever, refreshing, and entertaining flick. It may very well be the best movie in theaters right now.Excellent.",16 June 2008
I can't wait to see it again!,9,"Kung Fu Panda is the story of Po (an overweight, underachieving panda) who spends his days serving noodles at his father's restaurant and his nights dreaming of kung fu greatness. When the wise Master Oogwei (a tortoise) foretells the return of a deadly warrior who is bent on exacting revenge on their village, he and Master Shifu (a red panda) must find the fabled Dragon Warrior who is destined to save them all. Much to everyone's surprise, and seemingly by accident, Master Oogwei chooses Po. With entire village's fate in his hands, Po must face the countless doubters all around him as well as the doubt in his own heart.Though I was excited to go see this movie, I had some reservations. Jack Black's bumbling-yet-lovable shtick can be too much at times, and as a starring actor he can be rather polarizing. I'm happy to say that he blew me away in his role as Po. The part was clearly written for Jack Black and is very much in keeping with his personality, but rather than bringing out that annoying side of his, here he was nothing short of absolutely endearing. I suppose it doesn't hurt that Po is a roly poly panda bear, but Jack Black injected the character with so much heart and soul that you couldn't help rooting for him from the very start, no matter how hopeless it seemed. Indeed, he had the audience laughing out loud by the end of the very first line.Dustin Hoffman shines equally in his role as Master Shifu, the kung fu master charged with training Po in the art. While Po is clearly flawed, Shifu is just as insecure and uncertain due to past tragedy, and he too must learn to trust that destiny will right things in the end. A number of other well-known talents voiced the roles of the Furious Five, a team of warriors trained under Shifu. The Furious Five are all Dragon Warrior hopefuls (as well as Po's idols), until Po is picked over them. It was fun to recognize their voices (Angelina Jolie as Tigress, Lucy Liu as Viper, Seth Rogen as Mantis, Jackie Chan as Monkey, and David Cross as Crane), but their roles were largely unexplored. That's okay, I was so entertained by the developing relationship between Po and Shifu that I wasn't much interested in the rest of them. Other memorable supporting parts were the roles of Po's noodle chef father (who is, inexplicably, a goose), the prison warden (an imposing rhinoceros voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan), and Master Oogwei who was reminiscent of a softer, gentler Master Yoda and is brought to life so beautifully by Randall Duk Kim.The story itself is simple and predictable (and, as some critics have been quick to point out, clichéd), but it is told so well that I can't think of anything I would have changed. Obviously there is an element of the fantastic, but the plot is woven together so seamlessly that it is easy for small children to keep track of and yet interesting enough to keep adults on the edge of their seats. Speaking for myself, there were several scenes that had me biting my nails with anxiety, and others that brought tears to my eyes.Many of the laughs involved classic references to the martial arts movie genre. Having grown up in a household where martial arts movies were a big part of family movie nights, I can tell you that the writers definitely did their homework. Once again, critics will complain that they just recycled old clichés, but that's the point. Anyone who is a fan of old kung fu movies will appreciate how well researched this is. Honestly, anyone who complains of this as being ""unoriginal"" is probably the same kind of movie critic who will complain about there being too much singing and dancing in a musical. It's part of the genre, so love it or leave it. Lastly, the animation was absolutely incredible. Dreamworks really outdid themselves here. The characters' movements were graceful and fluid... well, maybe not Po's so much, but you get what I'm saying. This was absolutely vital in a movie that features so much movement, and the animators did a wonderful job. There was also such incredible attention to detail. I'd like to watch the movie several times over just to take it all in. And the way they captured the treacherous beauty of the Chinese mountain ranges was breathtaking. Several scenes looked just like Chinese watercolor paintings.In closing, I'd definitely recommend this movie to viewers of all ages looking for a movie that is hilarious yet moving, and visually stunning. The whole audience laughed and cried together, and the experience reminded me of why some movies have to be seen in theaters.",15 June 2008
"Animated slapstick, with a plot older than Shakespeare",2,"Might be fine for younger kids who haven't seen this same plot 100 different times. But I had to give up 30 minutes in.Po is a clumsy fool (picture Inspector Clouseau) with a good heart, somehow destined to become a hero and protect the world from an imprisoned villain who's apparently so dangerous that all the guards and kung fu experts in the rest of China can't handle him.When the wise old master selects Po to be the new ""dragon warrior"", the headmaster of the famous kung fu school is outraged, planning to force Po out of training by any means necessary.That's the first 30 minutes. Now really, how many adults reading this don't already know how the story plays out? Cute slapstick, though.",12 February 2009
This movie shows you how it's done.,10,"I saw this movie yesterday and BOY, what a home-run! It's funny, gorgeous, touching, wise and all-around awesome. This is the kind of movie that shows you how to make animation movies that can please adults and children.The tag line of the movie is ""Prepare for awesomeness"" and it is the most honest tag line I've ever read. Within 15 minutes, I was all giddy and repeating to my date ""This is awesome! This is awesome!"".Best line: ""There is no charge for awesomeness or attractiveness."" I gave it 10/10 . Instant classic. I beg you to go see it and I will personally flagellate my penis into a bloody pulp if you are anything but deeply, profoundly happy about seeing it.Go! Go! GO! (and take the kids too!)",21 June 2008
Perfect !,8,"I have just seen Kung Fu Panda and I thought it was brilliant. Never seen this type of flick before. Excellent story, very impressive mystical music (reminded me of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), a lot of magic, martial arts (can I use this term for this film ?)are blended, great fighting scenes and funny moments. Fighting over a cookie was amazing ! When you watch this film you'll understand what I mean. The end is unpredictable and has a very pleasing finish.This film's as different and unique as Cars or Shrek or Ratatoille when they came out. I was thoroughly entertained. I loved this movie. It's a must-buy DVD for your collection.10/10",21 June 2008
Fun film for the family.,6,"One perfect way to make Jack Black not too annoying: make him a cute computer-generated panda! Another fun, if not all too predictable film, has Po the Panda, a cook for his father's noodle shop, selected as being the legendary Dragon Warrior, much to the chagrin of five kung-fu artists and their master, who have spent their lives and then some trying to attain that goal.The movie is entirely predictable. Don't expect something different or unique done to the status quo of computer-generated animation and storytelling. But of that, Kung Fu Panda is much more entertaining than some of the other recent, past efforts, and the quality is above par as well! I found myself not minding Kung Fu Panda. Jack Black's voice is softer than his other films so Po's character isn't your usual Jack Black-like character. Thumbs up for a job well done.",15 June 2008
Panda Awesomeness,10,"In the climactic kung fu battle wannabe ""Dragon Warrior"" Tai Lung gazes upon the sacred Dragon Scroll which reveals the secret of Martial Arts Mastery and Power, and is left chagrined and perplexed. Panda Po (Jack Black) hysterically admits to the evil and powerful Snow Leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane), ""I didn't get it the first time either"" Jack Black is awesome as the kung fu Panda in Directors Mark Osbourne and John Stevenson's ""Kung Fu Panda""one of the best movies of the year so far. ""Kung Fu Panda"" is definitely one of the funniest and most entertaining movies in a long while. Screenwriters Jonathan Aibel and Glen Berger, and Storywriters Ethan Reiff and Cyrus Vows' ""Kung Fu Panda"" has an inspiring and familiar message. Even in its familiarity and crisp spot on humor, ""Kung Fu Panda"" is surprisingly touching. After all, this is an unlikely hero's transformation tale. At the story arc Po confesses to Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), ""If there is anyone who could... make me, not me""it is Shifu. ""Kung Fu Panda"" also gets it right for the story of martial arts mastery, and perhaps mastery as a whole. This is refreshing and is also a great message for kidsas trite as that sounds.Fat slacker Panda Po, who dreams one day of being a kung fu master, works for his Dad, Mr. Ping (James Hong) in the family noodle shop. Note that Po's father is a duck, who dreams one day that Po will take over the family business. In a bizarre circumstance ancient tortoise Master Oogway (Randal Duk Kim) chooses Po as the Dragon Warrior. As Dragon Warrior, Po inherits the secrets of the sacred Dragon Scroll. The Dragon Warrior must protect the Valley from the powerful Tai Lung, who seeks the Dragon Scroll for himself. Oogway's student Master Shifu (Hoffman) had raised the young and gifted snow leopard Tai Lung (McShane) as his own to become the Dragon Warrior. However, Oogway sensed the darkness in Tai Lung, and dismissed him as Dragon Warrior. Oogway was forced to defeat the enraged Tai Lung, and banish him. Now Tai Lung returns.Shifu tells Oogway he is horribly mistaken in choosing Po. Oogway reminds his old friend, ""There are no accidents."" He also tells Shifu that the Dragon Warrior will bring peace to the Valley and ""bring peace to you"". Shifu's students The Furious FiveTigress, Monkey, Mantis, Crane, and Viper, quickly dismiss Po. Admittedly, Po says ""I sucked more in the history of sucking"" In particular Tigress (insightful and arrogant Angelina Jolie) tells Po, ""You don't belong here."" Here Directors Osbourne and Stevenson deliver their message home. The pitfall of the greatly skilled is arrogance, and this is embodied by the Tigress and the Furious Five, and in fact Shifu. Surprisingly Shifu does not get it, until the end. Shifu can't rely on what he knows to make Po this great Dragon Warrior. A master can only show The Path or The Way, and it is up to the student to reclaim the greatness within. It is all about discipline, courage, and humility. ""Kung Fu Panda"" does all this in a very hilarious and visually spectacular package. I was laughing hysterically during the training session with Po and Shifu as they dueled with chopsticks over a delicious dumpling. The Furious Five trading blows with Tai Lung on the hanging mountain bridges was visually stunning.Jack Black really makes ""Kung Fu Panda"" work. As voiced by Black, Po realizes the ridiculousness of his situation, but ultimately realizes this is his last chance to own up to his own greatness. Black is both hysterical and profoundly genuine. Dustin Hoffman is amazing as Shifu. Ironically and humorously he is a martial arts master, albeit a rodent of some sort, in love with his own accomplishments, clueless to The Way. Fortunately, Po comes into his life. Randal Duk Kim is great as the true Master Oogway. Angelina Jolie is brash and spirited as the skilled Tigress.""Kung Fu Panda"" is one the best movies of the year. Besides being hysterical fun, it has great heart and a wonderful story. See ""Kung Fu Panda"".",15 June 2008
Dreamworks Animation with an Asian Flare,10,"I love shows and movies that are set in Asia and also animal films too...Like this excellent film. In this film, Po the Panda, was the laziest of all the animals in the Valley of Peace and a typical ""I'm your biggest fan"" kind of guy when it comes to the Furious Five. With a powerful enemy Tai Lung the Snow Leopard at the gates, all hope is pinned on a martial arts hero known as ""The Dragon Warrior"" to rise to save the day. When Po unwittingly shows up in the midst of the martial arts competition, the masters are shocked to see that this unmotivated panda bears the mark of the Chosen One. I love (out the Furious Five) Tigress and Monkey. Did you know that the individual fighting styles of the Furious Five members (Crane, Mantis, Tiger, Monkey and Viper) are actual martial art styles modeled after those particular animals.I don't have a favorite scene, because I love the WHOLE film and it's lesson on believing in yourself and being your own hero - age-old lessons that I don't mind at all. And I do love the musical score by Hans Zimmer and John Powell. As I say a million times I love an excellent soundtrack in a movie.",14 June 2008
Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon + Once Upon a Time in China + Jackie Chan's Drunken Master + Bruce Lee + Shaw Brothers Movies + 3D Animation = Kung Fu Panda,10,"Firstly I can say that I am blown up by this movie. I am a fan of cartoon movies and I also a fan of Kung Fu movies. I can say that this movie is an amalgam of the many past Hong Kong kung fu movies from Shaw Brothers Wire Fu to Bruce Lee to Jackie Chan to Jet Lee in the wrapping of 3D animation.When I watch Po, I remember Jackie Chan in The Drunken Master. When I watch Master Shifu, I remember many of the white haired kung fu teachers characters to Jet Li's Master Wong Fei Hung. When I watch Master Crane, I remember Fu Shen's depiction of Fang Shih Yu on high poles. When I watched Master Tigress and Master Viper, I remember those lady kung fu warriors from Cheng Pei-pei to Michelle Yeoh to Zhang Zi Yi. When I watch Master Mantis and Master Monkey, I remember kung fu stars like Liu Jia Liang, Gordon Liu, and many others.The training devices so much resembles many Shaw Brothers kung fu movies with pivoting parts and so on. I particularly remember the Shao Lin wooden man scenes from those movies.The fight scene between Tai Lung and Master Shifu resembles many scenes from Hong Kong kung fu movies about a skillful students goes bad. The fight scene between the Furious Five and Tai Lung resembles many Jet Li's/Modern kung Fu Movies (like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) fight scenes. The fight scene between Po and Tai Lung is literally taken from Jackie Chan's Drunken Master/old movies. When Master Shifu told Po to hit the doll, Po was imitating Bruce Lee's moves.The story is not unfamiliar in many from zero to hero Kung Fu movies with doubts from the teacher, the hard training and so on, also with the antics and humor in them.In short, this movie encased all the good times in kung fu cinema in the clothing of 3D cartoon animation, almost too much for me to digest. I had a really really really good time watching this movie and could not stop laughing from start to finish.",14 June 2008
A new Classic for both kids and adults...,10,"I didn't have too much hope for this movie, although I like most of Jack Black's movies,and I'm glad to say I was wrong!!! This movie is great in many levels, it ain't silly-funny and doesn't rely on anacronich humor like Shrek heavily does (you know, modern stuff being used on medieval times)or belch and fart jokes, the only ""modern"" thing I found was the fact that Po the main character it's somewhat of a Fan boy of the legendary Kung Fu Warriors (it has their action figures and collects souvenirs), other than that it's a great Kung-fu ""chosen one"" type movie done with the best animation I have seen in years, it felt kinda short, but it's a great film to watch ... and collect.",13 June 2008
On par with Pixar's best,9,"One of the best animated films I've seen in a long while. Dreamworks is finally showing it can overcome the mediocrity of movies like Shrek, Bee Movie, and Madagascar, and put out a film that is not only fun, but shows excellence in animation as well. The CG animation easily stands up next to Pixar's work, and even the 2-D animated opening was beautifully done. I would've loved to see them even do the whole film in that style.Plenty of laughs to be had for audiences of any age. A truly enjoyable movie and likely the best animated film we'll see this year. (Sorry, but Wall-E isn't doing anything for me so far)",13 June 2008
Really cute and fun!,9,"Kung Fu Panda, when I saw this trailer, I have to admit, it looked pretty lame, it just seemed like a typical CGI kids film that wouldn't be much fun for the grown up's and like it would be forced humor. But I decided to go ahead and see the movie today, I'm so glad that I gave it chance because this was such an enjoyable film not just for me, but the kids as well. As I looked around the theater, everyone was just having so much fun watching Kung Fu Panda, the jokes, the animation, the voices, the story, I felt like I was watching real kung fu movie. The action sequences were so exciting and you couldn't help but just cheer for the warriors. I loved how the animals represented all the kung fu movie: the viper, the tiger, the praying mantas, the monkey, the crane, and the panda. This movie is just so much for the entire family to watch.Po is a panda who is just dreaming of one day to learn kung fu like his idols, the fantastic five, but his father wishes for him to take over their noodle restaurant. Bu when Oogway has a vision and tells Shifu that he is having a vision of Tai Lung, a student gone evil, is about to come back, he picks the ""dragon warrior"", which is Po. But Shifu sees Po as well as the fantastic five, they're all disappointed and don't believe in him. But after Tai Lung escapes, Shifu has to learn to believe in Po and help him with the strengths and the ""secret ingredient"" that he has.Kung Fu Panda is one of the year's most fun and entertaining movies that anyone could enjoy. I know that most of Dreamwork's cartoon films are not always as memorable as the Disney and Pixar combination, but they do pull out some great films. I just loved the scene where Shifu is training Po how to fight and they realize that it is food that is Po's strength, the fight for a dumpling was just so much fun and incredibly entertaining. I really enjoyed Kung Fu Panda with a passion, it's a big recommendation, it has great comedy, and some really terrific characters that will all get you in the mood for some kung fu fighting. Not to mention: Jack Black, Jackie Chan, Angelina Jolie, Dustin Hoffman, and Lucy Lui, plus many more, how could you not love a cast like that? Believe me, this is a fun movie.9/10",7 June 2008
"Its hard work that matters, not fate",2,"I hate the idea behind this movie, which is that it doesn't matter how hard you work or train; its all about fate and destiny. You can be a mediocre but if you are the chosen one, don't worry, you will not only surpass everybody else but you will be the best. Tell this to every athlete and see what his response will be. Our kids should learn that to make a difference in sports, you must work hard, train hard, eat well. You will not win a medal just because you horoscope says so. In the movie, although the hero trains and works at last, it will not match the years and whole life dedication of training that other members of the team have. So the movie has a very bad moral teaching.",20 September 2015
"Not really fresh, rather boring",3,"I found Kung Fu Panda to be rather boring and very typical. The plot has been done many times and the other times it were done better. I also found the jokes and gags in this film to be way too childish and immature. I know its meant for children and younger teens but this film just didn't seem that great, and it also sends a rather bad message. Kung Fu Panda brings us absolutely nothing new. Perhaps it's me getting older, but the humor nowadays feels very shallow in these animated movies. And the almost non-stop violence, because there really is. I don't mind action movies, or even martial arts movies but this is clearly a movie with intended major demographics in ages 8-12, and hopefully a sizeable number of high school kids so the music and animation must be perfected. The characters were okay. Jack Black was the right choice for Po, along with the other cast but overall the film was for the most part plain boring.",7 October 2010
Mediocre Panda,5,"Can't believe the number of glowing reviews this has been getting. The Incredibles, the Toy Story movies, Shrek 2, Monsters Inc.--those movies deserve glowing reviews. This one was entertaining but forgettable.The story has no surprises at all. Po is named the Chosen One. Po trains to fight bad guy, initially frustrating crotchety trainer but ultimately winning him over. Po fights bad guy and wins. That's it. That's the whole story.You'd think with a story that thin there'd be lots of room for character development. But there wasn't. There were a lot of pratfalls. Jack Black improvised the occasional bit of funny dialogue, but there weren't a lot of laughs in my theater. The Furious Five characters had no personalities at all. The villain was villainous in the most familiar and boring way possible. Visually, the movie had some nice moments. The fight scenes were fun to watch. I really enjoyed the villain's escape from a very impressive prison. I also liked the look of the turtle Master. And the scene in which Po is trained to become great at kung fu using his desire to eat a dumpling was great. But overall the movie was unsatisfying.",8 June 2008
"Not a disaster, just a bit disappointing.",6,"It is not a disaster, but I thought that ""Kung Fu Panda"" was a bit disappointing.""Kung Fu Panda"" is big, bright and colourful (and, by the way, looks wonderful in an IMAX DMR print). It does have wonderful animation, some nice comedy sequences and good characters, but ""Kung Fu Panda"" is not nearly as funny as it could have been, and is severely lacking in character.I think the worst crime of ""Kung Fu Panda"" is the waste of a potentially top class voice cast. Half the fun of modern animated movies, especially for adults, is in the spotting of various celebrity voices having fun. ""Kung Fu Panda"" manages to leech all of the character and idiosyncraticness out of the voices of fine character actors like Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, and others, that you may as well have used a cast of unknowns.A real shame, then, but not a total waste. My Nephew (12 years old) liked it. My Niece (11 years old) thought that it was OK.",25 August 2008
Really Surprised by this Film,8,"Kung Fu Panda is one of the better animated films of the year. Of course that's not saying much because most animated films are all about humor that is constantly in your face and is on the verge of being annoying. I went to see this on the recommendation of a friend which surprised me since he HATES kids movies like these nowadays. Walking out of this I can say that my friend was right as this really does deliver for a movie called ""Kung Fu Panda."" Now the plot is basically pretty generic. A panda who dreams of becoming a kung fu master, when he just sells noodles. One day he is chosen by the wise old turtle as the one who will stop a evil snow leopard. Then he basically goes through training for most of the movie. The plot is not the glowing part of the movie except their is some charm in seeing this buffoon, for lack of a better term, grow into a kung fu master.No, what makes Kung Fu Panda shine is the action in the movie. And not only the action but the characters as well. I'm talking of course about the villain and the master. The villain in this movie may have seemed pretty generic, but he's the first villain in a long time that actually scared me. And also the old master is pretty well done too. But the action in the movie is spot-on. Some of the action scenes are really intense. The humor in this movie was nice to because it was a departure from that piece of garbage that was Shrek the Third where humor was just out their in the open because it needed to be. None of this humor felt forced, and the opening sequence was just laugh out loud funny. In short, see this movie and go in with an open mind. I'm guessing that you will be pleasantly surprised.",30 June 2008
"""You wanna go see Kung Fu Panda?"" ""....Yes.""",8,"Since the explosion of computer generated animation onto the big screen in recent years, Dreamworks has been the main perpetrator in overexposing the world to the genre. For every brilliant, nurtured and expertly crafted Pixar creation there is a lazy Dreamworks equivalent, heavily relying on pop culture references and famous voice talent to disguise the fact that the films suck. Yes, I'm including Shrek in this. It is a bad movie and after just seven years looks ridiculously dated. So what does any of this have to do with Kung Fu Panda? Well, because somehow Dreamworks have managed to perform a complete U-turn in their thinking and release an animated movie that isn't just good, it is excellent. I say 'somehow,' although it doesn't take William James Sidis to realise that when Pixar are receiving ten times more critical and commercial acclaim than you are, following their blueprint for success might just be a good idea.So what is detailed on this blueprint? A good storyline for a start, which in Kung Fu Panda is essentially Star Wars without the stars. A Panda named Po dreams of becoming a martial arts master whilst stuck in his day job at the noodle restaurant (which, you know, is so indicative of Chinese culture.) He gets his shot when Yoda makes Obi-Wan Kenobi take Po as a padawan and train him in the ways of the kung fu force just in time to combat the evil Darth Vader, who has recently escaped from a prison staffed entirely by rhinos and is looking to exact bloody vengeance on his former master and rule the Chinese galaxy. Except in this case Yoda is a tortoise named Oogway, Obi-Wan is...something called Shifu and Vader is a snow leopard named Tai Lung. Additionally, there are five other martial arts masters, the legendary Furious Five (a tiger, a crane, a mantis, a viper and a monkey), who were trained by Shifu and do not take kindly to Po's intrusion into their perfectly balanced lives. Intersperse this with several scenes of ass kicking seemingly lifted from Jackie Chan's 'Legend of the Drunken Master' and you have one potent recipe for success.However, the characters must be interesting and likable for the story to work. Thankfully they all are. From the initial dream narration of Jack Black's eponymous panda (his first truly funny role since 'School Of Rock') through to the final scene, the excellent voice work coupled with the stellar animation brings each and every character satisfyingly to life. Stand-outs include Dustin Hoffman as master Shifu, Ian McShane, who introduces a sense of dignity into Tai Lung not consistent with bad guys in children's films, and Randall Duk Kim as Oogway, who receives some of the funniest lines. He also pulls the best facial expressions.The only problem with Kung Fu Panda is the relative under-utilisation of the Furious Five. Here we have characters voiced by the likes of Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Seth Rogen, Lucy Liu and David Crane and they are not really given enough chances to speak at all. Jackie Chan's Monkey, for instance, has about three lines of dialogue. Also, aside from their fantastic fight scene against Tai-Lung, they have little to do. This is clearly something to be exploited for the inevitable sequels, unless the whole word goes mental and decides to see Shrek 4 in record numbers, prompting parts 5 to 8 to be rushed into production instead of KFPII. Luckily, the world will then explode from the sheer irrationality of that event ever happening, so we'll never have to see them.Basically, Dreamworks have produced a movie that both fans and people that intensely dislike their studio will enjoy. Sure, it probably won't be as rewarding as Pixar's Wall-E but who cares? As master Oogway says, ""Quit, don't quit. Noodles, don't noodles."" Think about that one. Or don't.",29 June 2008
"Put Jack Black's voice in a warm big fluffy Panda, and you just have to love him.",8,"Even though he is as much a motor-mouth as so many other actors who become annoying with time, there is something incessantly likable about Jack Black. Put his voice in a warm big fluffy Panda, and you just have to love him. Put this Panda in a Kung Fu setting complete with training-school dojo, grand masters and a nemesis to fear, and you have the first Dreamworks Animation movie that can stand up among Pixar's annual excellence as one of the best 3D animation movies made.A Giant Panda is a 250-pound black-and-white bear that lives in the mountains of China, and although carnivorous, the panda has a diet which is 99% bamboo. That's how pacifist it is. But when Po (Jack Black) gets accidentally selected as the mighty Dragon Warrior by the Grand Master, there is no option left but for Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) to train the clumsy Panda into a Warrior of the highest order  much to the resentment of the Furious Five (Tigress, Monkey, Viper, Crane, Mantis). But Po, as much as he loves Kung Fu lore, would rather eat. Yes, that's how pacifist he is. But Master Shifu has not much choice as his ex-student, the evil Tai Lung, has escaped from his maximum security prison to claim the position of Dragon Warrior for himself.Some sequences in this movie are breathtaking, I exulted at the thought of animation finally telling us such diverse stories. Two sequences (and this is not a spoiler): Tai Lung's escape from prison and the foot-bridge fight are extraordinary in exigency. Dreamworks has been churning out animated movies for a few years now, but apart from Shrek, none of their movies have really hit any mark. But this is easily the best animated movie out of their bucket yet. The voice cast, although stellar, does not overshadow the characters with their star-power. The likes of Jackie Chan and Angelina Jolie get limited voice-time, but just as much as the movie requires. Jack Black & Dustin Hoffman are wonderful as loud obnoxious student & controlled cool master. And unlike Madagascar, the movie has very soft colors, curves and a glowing focus. It works very well with the cuddly look of the Panda.A special mention for Tai Lung. Not since Lion King's Scar has a villain taken himself so seriously. Tai Lung is a warrior extraordinaire, and he is beyond humor or humility. Just like Jeremy Irons' Scar, Ian McShane's Tai Lung speaks with a sense of superiority. It makes him that much more of a nemesis  a villain worthy of a much more formidable opponent than a pacifist panda. See, that's how impressive his sense of superiority is! My rating --> 4 of 5",22 June 2008
That was Delightful!,9,"Kung Fu Panda - Po the Panda (Jack Black) must somehow become a Kung Fu Master in order to save the Valley of Peace from a villainous snow leopard, Tai Lung. Set in the legendary world of ancient China, it features the voice talents of Angelina Jolie, David Cross, Dustin Hoffman, Seth Rogen, Lucy Liu, and Jackie Chan (kind of).At first glance the movie looked like a pass, mostly because of a crap title and Jack Black's less than good batting average lately. The kung fu genre has also kind of been mocked and done to death. This is the day of CGI and the superheroes.But this movie, on the whole, is delightful. It is funny and cool, and not in a topical way. It also stays away from the usual fart and pee jokes that movie execs push in when they can't admit they don't know what kids like these days. No. This movie is actually honest to goodness funny. It's also got some very good action sequences, and doesn't do the same tired montages we've seen before. Po learning shaolin in a couple days seems to go down a lot smoother than Daniel-san winning a karate contest after a week of manual labor, because of the excellent decision to do this in cartoon format, and because of Po himself. There hasn't been quite this good a protagonist in an animated film in awhile. Po is a goodnatured but cowardly and overweight nerd, just like most martial arts nerds. He's the sort of guy who worships the martial arts, like me and my friends used to (hell, still do), but never had the time or discipline to learn (1 year of Aikido and 3 months of Tae Kwon Do for me. Nothing stuck). Speaking of martial arts, the movie doesn't shy away from the action either. There's about as much awesomeness as a PG cartoon can get away with. The animators did an excellent job. Of course this movie treads on familiar ground (""believing in yourself"" etc etc). It's a labor of love towards the martial arts and an attempt to keep their spirit alive.Jack Black plays it just right without going overboard like he's prone to do, and the result is one of my favorite characters in their extensive movie list. Dustin Hoffman plays sound support as the Red Panda Master. Seh Rogen is hilarious and Ian McShane always plays a good villain as the Evil Leopard Tai Lung. It was a pleasant surprise to hear Michael Clarke Duncan and David Cross as well.I'll probably purchase the DVD for this one. A truly pleasant surprise from a movie I expected little from about a panda nobody expected anything from, Kung Fu Panda gets an A-.(now don't get greedy an make a sequel now. I had to endure trailers for Madagascar 2 and Pink Panther 2 to get to this)",21 June 2008
An Enjoyable Movie to Enjoy with Great Enjoyment,9,"Go. See. This. Movie.First of all, thank God for an animated kids movie with no fart jokes in it! The humor is cute, satirical, ironic, or slapstick, but not cheap or vulgar.And don't worry about being too old for this movie. I'm 49, and I, my wife, my 18 y.o. son, and my 21 y.o. daughter all thought it was great! I was *rolling* on the floor at some of the dialog and situations. In the opening scene, Jack Black begins ""Legend tells of a legendary hero whose kung fu skills were the stuff of Le-Gend-uh"" - classic!I think the re-watch potential for this movie is really pretty high, even for adults - there are nuances and jokes in throwaway lines and in the edges of the screen, that bear looking for in 2nd and 3rd viewings.And at times, just sit back and admire some of the most beautiful scenery animation - the scene of Po under the Peach Tree of Wisdom as the camera pans back holds just long enough for you to just look and admire the artistic work that went into this movie.Don't get me wrong - this is hardly ""film"" - but definitely ""an enjoyable movie to enjoy with great enjoyment,"" as Po might say.(Tip: try to go to a show that is past most small children's bedtime - some of the little kids at our showing lost it at the 1 hour mark, most kids can sit still for only so long.)",20 June 2008
Awesome movie full of bodacity,10,"This movie works well for kids, teens, and adults. My family went to this for Father's Day and two 40ish-year-olds, 19 year old, 18 year old, and 15 year old all thoroughly enjoyed it, laughing out loud numerous times throughout the movie.It was a mix of old kung fu movie nostalgia, The Matrix fight scene choreography, awesome animation, and the humor of Jack Black. A winning combination and I hope they do a sequel because I could have watched this all day.The movie has a great story that keeps you you in anticipation, is paced very well, and while you know how this movie will end it is still surprising and pays off in a big way.",16 June 2008
Great for kids and adults!,9,This movie was funny me and my five year old daughter went to go see this movie yesterday. I always think movies like this are nothing but another kids movie. But this was pretty funny. Not only this is a comedy but it also has morals in this movie. But mainly scenes to make you laugh. I definitely recommend to see this movie 100%. you will definitely think different about this movie but not another kiddie movie. This movie also contains some morals for kids that help raise a good kid until they become teenagers. ha ha ha! But this is also kind of violent for kids so..... parental guidance suggested you know. You will not regret seeing this show.,15 June 2008
"Nothing new, but still fresh",9,"Family movies over the past couple of years have digressed into mindless entertainment, save a few examples. The humor has been shallow, nearly non-existent. To me a family movie is something where the entire family enjoy it. The humor appeals to both children (potty humor, slap stick) to the older crowd (CLEVERLY disguised innuendo and classic media references). I would argue that Family movies are the most difficult genre to work in, because one must successfully strike that delicate balance while being neither preachy or boring.Kung Fu Panda is a worthy entry in to the pantheon of the classics. While I am not arrogant enough to place this one on the level of Disney from the golden age to the Pixar achievements, it makes its own unique contribution to a tired story that has been played out time and time again. The kind hearted, but initially inept subject overcoming their shortcomings is a movie staple. However, its treatment in this story is fresh. The voice actors play their bits wonderfully. While I was aware of a star studded cast going in, they allowed their characters to speak for them rather than vice versa.So, the contrived plot points are really what hold this movie back. But, the humor with how they are treated allow this to be looked over. Instead, look for the interesting way that clichés are handled. I enjoyed this film. I had fun, and that's what I wanted.",14 June 2008
Prepare for absolute awesomeness,10,"Finally, an animated-CGI film I absolutely adore! I love Jack Black as it was, but him as a panda is the icing on the cake.Black voices Po, a lovable yet lazy panda who is chosen as the legendary Dragon Warrior. The Dragon Warrior is the master of Kung Fu who will protect China from the deadly Tai Laung. Problem is, Po's trainer Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) believes it's a mistake and that one of the Furious Five should be chosen. All the voices and animals are remarkably charming minus Tigress (Jolie). With loads of action, comedy, bright colors and an amazing time, Po rises to complete awesomeness.You will laugh, maybe cry at Po and his comrades in this wonderfully paced adventure comedy from Dreamworks. Hopefully, it's great success won't lead to a sequel which would ruin its spunk. I personally think I laughed more than the little kids in the theater, it appeals to adults and kids, mostly adults I think.",13 June 2008
"Beautifully filmed, disgusting, politically correct",2,"From the technical standpoint, it's excellent.From the point of the idea it promotes - it's disgusting. What's the idea? To succeed, you don't have to work hard. Just be a good guy, have good heart, overcome yourself, and you will win and succeed in no time more than 5 superstars who were working in this area for years.This is patented politically-correct American ideology: professionalism is not important; communication skills are. Work on your soul a little bit, and you will achieve what you want.In fact, it's ""Forrest Gump"" for kids. The idiot has an inherent advantage. The smart and capable will always trip in the critical moment, and the idiot will win.What does it teach the kids? you don't have to work hard. No need to spend years on training and polishing your skills. No need to be smart.

Charming,9,"Po is a big panda who dreams of being a great warrior. One day when the search for the Dragon Warrior is announced-Po heads off to see who is chosen, never dreaming that he will be chosen to be the hero and forced to fight a terrible villain.Charming wonderful marvelous animated film from Dreamworks is possibly the best cartoon they have put out. Essentially a really good martial arts film with animals this film scores where earlier films like Shrek failed in that the point of the film is the story and not the one liners. Yes there are clever lines but its the characters and the story that are paramount.The real story here is the voice cast which is perfect. Jack Black has a wonderfully modulated performance that isn't too much. As for the rest of the cast Angelina Jolie,Dustin Hoffman, Ian McShane, Lucy Liu, Jackie Chan and Michael Clarke Duncan all disappear into their parts so well that for the most part I had no idea who was voicing which part.I loved this movie a great deal and it was great seeing what is essentially a father and son story on Father's day.You really should see this.",15 June 2008
"""Kung Fu Panda"" gives a fresh kick to an overused formula. Skidoosh.",8,"""Kung Fu Panda"" is not your typical cgi product from the precisely calibrated Dreamworks animated animal film machine. While first glance at a trailer or poster will have you believing that the cgi family film powerhouse has simply extended its range to include the animals native to the far east, Dreamworks has just used those techniques to sell you a film that actually deviates from the formula with which we have become so accustomed. I wouldn't go as far as to call ""Panda"" innovative, but more so that it stays fresh amidst the over- processed films of its kind.""Panda"" stars Jack Black as Po, the overweight Panda who is the son of a noodle-making goose. While Po's father hopes to pass down the noodle-making business, of course Po dreams otherwise. He loves the world of ancient kung fu and his idols are the Furious Five, five kung fu-trained animals that serve to protect the village. When the kung fu palace's old master has a vision of bad things to come, a dragon warrior must be chosen to fight this evil and Po, trying to see who will be named, appears to accidentally get chosen. The first thing this movie does right is focus on Po. Po is lovable because he tries hard and dreams big despite his obvious flaws and his humor--via Jack Black--is the one part of the film that doesn't take itself seriously. As a result, Po is probably the easiest character to identify with in the entire cannon of Dreamworks animated films. While the voices of the Furious Five include Angelina Jolie, Seth Rogen, Lucy Liu and more, and their master is played by Dustin Hoffman, these actors are purely supporting, proving they were brought in merely to sell the film. While some people might be disappointed, it's the right thing for this film. Po's journey is enough to focus on. While I expected Hoffman, for example, to really make the part his own, he stays very true to the written character. Any no-names could have played the 5 and considering the movie is still enjoyable despite it, that's a very good thing.Perhaps the most commendable aspect of ""Panda"" is its family- friendly comedy. There aren't more than 5 or so jokes that make you laugh really hard like the ""Shrek"" franchise does, but those movies were funny because they slipped in jokes for a PG-13 or higher audience. This film appeals to kids, teens, adults and the like without doing that stuff, by relying on already-present humor and not looking toward outside sources/pop culture references. In 30 years, it is possible this movie will be looked at by young audiences as funnier than ""Shrek"" for this reason and it should. There are also some spectacular action sequences, namely when the villain Tai Lung escapes. The smartly conceived fighting choreography is probably the most underrated aspect of the film.""Panda"" may never be more than cute, clever and fun, but a G film should be without trying to sneak in inappropriate jokes. This is truly a film reminiscent of Disney's wholesome animated days when it was about just writing stories people had to like. The overdone values of believing in yourself and making something out of who you are don't feel overdone in this film--they feel right. Next to the unrivaling unique ""Ratatouille,"" ""Panda"" is right there when it comes to family-friendly wide-appeal films.",8 June 2008
An over-weight and out-of-shape panda is chosen to be the new Dragon Master,1,"Maybe I missed something in this movie, but I thought it was one of the worst movies I have seen in quite some time. At least for adults. True, there were a few cute jokes, but how many jokes can be done at the expense of the panda being fat and flabby before the audience, even children, say Okay, we got it. The theater was about 2/3 full and for most of this movie people were getting up to leave; adults and children. A man a few seats down was snoring, which was one of the more entertaining aspects of this movie. Some of the dialogue was muddled and some of the action so fast it was hard to keep up and not get a headache. It had a nice basic plot, which was okay, but there were aspects of this movie that were not fully developed, and this included character development. For example, when Po asks his dad if he's really his dad (since the dad was a duck). I would have liked to see more development of the main characters, other than Hoffman's, as that would have at least added something to the movie for the adults. And apparently not too many kids liked this movie either, at least on the day we went, since throughout the entire movie they were talking, and not about the movie. And for the most part, the voices for each character fit, but Black's voice for Po just did not work well for the personality for the character on screen. It seemed like Black was holding back, which is too bad, since, like Robin Williams, for example, you let them go and what comes out is pure magic. Even in animation and the dialogue is more scripted.",5 July 2008
"The big, fat and silly waist of my time.",3,"There's a conspiracy around the world! I kid you not! Apparently me and my family saw some different version of the Kung Fu Panda movie than the rest of the world.Unfortunately, reading the other comments assured me of the opposite. At least the plot and special effects/kung fu combats, mentioned by everyone else, seem just the same.Look, I really liked the main idea of"" there's no secret ingredient"", which, by the way, was pretty obvious to me from the start. But throwing it in as a mere side note, instead of building a good story around this comfortably familiar (though redundant) concept, was a pretty lame idea.The whole movie feels like a 5-minute silly and funny at some parts TV gag stretched for the entire hour and a half - no character development, including the main hero, not a single fresh idea (which could be forgivable sometimes, but no redeeming value here) - just wonderfully executed kung fu fights. So, if you're a fan of those - you'd be pretty satisfied. In case, you're not - you won't.I was really hoping this movie has something under its sleeve, as some first facial exchanges between the two old masters took place, yet, ultimately, they had no special meaning at all. And while we saw a dubbed Russian version, I really can't understand why would anyone hire such a star-studded English cast for voicing a few lines for absolutely unneeded kung fu masters characters. I doubt Angelina Jolie's or Jacki Chan's voices could do any difference here.Not to mention, that this whole idea of ""a simple good guy"" who comes and succeeds at what fail the long-time experts for absolutely no understandable reason (apparently learning all the principles in one day because he wanted to get some dumplings) - look, it really starts to get on my nerves. Really.",20 July 2008
"Surprisingly Good, But Inconsistent...",6,"*** SPOILER ALERT ***To be honest, I think this time Dreamworks surprise me. I really think they delivered one good animated movie with their latest Kung Fu Panda. It was cute, beautifully rendered, and had a lovable characters.Unfortunately, Dreamworks will be Dreamworks and here is why:Kung Fu Panda was fun, sure. But it didn't have something that Dreamworks should work very hard to achieve its goal: a great story. Yes, I know the story was rather 'good', so was the action sequences, the music from Hans Zimmer was enchanting, the China background is spectacular too. But it wasn't enough! Remember, they compete with the animation giant: Pixar. Maybe the bar was set very high it will be difficult to compete with Pixar. But they should try, although I think this is kind of great for a start.Kung Fu Panda tells a story about a fat panda, Po. He was addicted to kungfu. Unfortunately, he doesn't have the 'qualities' for being good at kungfu or any kind of sports (not surprising since he was very fat and slow). Meanwhile, far from Po, one of the most dangerous villain on China - Tai Lung - is escaped from prison. So Oogway, the famous and respectable guru try to gathered all warriors from China to pick one of them to be The Dragon Warrior. Surprisingly to everyone, Po was chosen. Along the way, Po tries so hard to believe in himself and making everyone believe that he - the fat panda - will bring peace to China.I said I was surprised. Why? From the beginning until the first half of the movie, Kung Fu Panda tells us about one of the most important philosophy in the eastern world: the grand design of the universe. Oogway told everyone that Po was destined to be The Dragon Warrior, and it was not an accident. Simply because 'there was no accident'. Everything in the universe was design in its way that we as a living being couldn't do anything about it but Accept it and Believe in it.But then, on a second half of the movie it fails to satisfies me. Finally Po believe in himself after he saw the Dragon Scroll. The Dragon Scroll is one and only ancient scroll that only can be seen by the Dragon Warrior itself. And it contains nothing. No words, no moves, only a plain paper that interestingly reflects every face who sees it. Later Po knows that all he could do to beat Tai Lung is to believe in himself. At the end of the story, Po was suddenly learn one of the deadliest move of all time.How he could learn that moves, is still a mystery to me. After a brief introduction to the eastern philosophy this movie choose a safe, dull, weird ending. What happened to the grand-design-believe-in-yourself-there-was-no-accident thing? Maybe Dreamworks was scared that the 'heavy message' won't reach to the younger audience. But I think they should try harder to make it still believable to your sense.Overall, Kung Fu Panda fails to satisfies me. But its still one of the funniest summer movie out there. I hope Dreamworks will delivered something magical and smarter next time. Although being alert that Madagascar 2 and Shrek Goes Forth is going along, I just pray for those two won't be another Dreamworks Animation Disaster.Oh, and Angelina Jolie and Jackie Chan were such a waste...",26 July 2008
"Simple, but surprisingly good.",7,"Dreamworks Animation has it very tough now a days, living forever in the shadow of Pixar. But it's been hard to feel sorry for them. In the seven years after the smash success of the movie ""Shrek"", they've only managed to churn out one mediocre and simplistic animated film after the other, set apart only by their top celebrity voices, and laden with kids only humor and tired pop-culture jokes. They haven't been bad per say, but when the competition is the likes of Toy Story or Finding Nemo, you start to wish they'd try a little harder. Now along comes Kung Fu Panda, easily the best CGI kids film the studio has come up with. It's nothing spectacular, but it's great fun, and probably the most fun a family can have together at the movies this summer...in a movie without trash cleaning robots.The trailers for this film did nothing for me, but the minute its exciting and hilarious 2D opening was done, I knew I was for in something good. The story is definitely not the movie's strong point. It tells the basic tale of Po, voiced by Jack Black, a young and very overweight Great Panda and son of a noodle salesman, who dreams of one day being a Kung Fu master and joining the ranks of his idols, The Furious Five (characters representing the five classic styles of Shaolin Kung-fu: a tiger, crane, monkey, mantis, and snake, voiced by Angelina Jolie, David Cross, Jackie Chan, Seth Rogen and Lucy Liu respectively). When a premonition warns of the escape of the evil kung fu master Tai-Lung (Ian McShane), former student of the stern sensei Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), it is decided that the sacred title of ""Dragon Warrior"" must be given to a brave soul in hopes of stopping him. That title unsurprisingly lands on Po. As you might expect, there is a lot of doubting, and worry, until Po learns about the ""hero within"" and...well you've seen it all before. It's very bare bones, but it's acceptable enough when the movie's strengths work so well.The voices and animation are top notch thankfully. All the actors fit well with their characters (Black can do the hefty underdog routine in his sleep) and do a fine job without a hint of them phoning it in, with Hoffman and McShane as the real standout. Hoffman excels as the up tight wise man or teacher that all Kung Fu movies need, though the Furious Five have a disappointingly smaller role then it seems they should, but have some great moments as well. The animation is crisp and beautiful; this film's fantasized world of ancient China really shines, and must be seen on the big screen. The animation lends itself well to the film's main attraction-the fights. You may think a PG rated kid's film might skimp on quality fights, ""Kung Fu"" in the title or not, but in this case you'd be very mistaken. The fights are fast paced, thrilling, and delightfully executed (even borrowing some choreography from various well known kung fu flicks in some occasions) and for a PG movie, somewhat brutal. Nothing too serious mind you, but if you're a prude when it comes to kids and violence, beware. Neither the heroes nor the villain in this movie mess around when it comes to the fights. The movie also seems to be a bit lacking in the humor department, which takes back seat to the action. It's still funny (without having to resort to Pop-culture gags even), but it really isn't the laugh a minute comedy you or your kids might be expecting.The film's other strong point is its villain. Even in best children movies, a villain's motivation usually never stretches beyond ""because he's evil"", so imagine my surprise when Kung-Fu Panda not only provides its bad guy with some well done back story and motivation, but even manages to make him a little sympathetic. There's a scene between him and Shifu near the end that contains some strong themes that'll fly over most children's heads, and is a treat to watch. As mentioned, McShane's voice is a major standout, bringing Tai Lung to life with a sneering and devilish quality. The movie chickens out at the end unfortunately, in order to stay kid friendly, shying it away from greatness. While it still fails just short of the quality and heart of the Pixar films (well, it's better than Cars anyway), KFP still provides a lot of fun and thrills for kids and grown ups a like. It's a fun, simple little summer film that any family should look into, especially if you happen to be raising little kung-fu fans of your own.",13 July 2008
